http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09497v1;"Interplay between Defects, Disorder and Flexibility in Metal-Organic
  Frameworks";"  Metal-organic frameworks are a novel family of chemically diverse materials,
which are of interest across engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, and
medicine-based disciplines. Since the development of the field in its current
form more than two decades ago, priority has been placed on the synthesis of
new structures. However, more recently, a clear trend has emerged in shifting
the emphasis from material design to exploring the chemical and physical
properties of those already known. In particular --- while such nanoporous
materials were traditionally seen as rigid crystalline structures --- there is
growing evidence that large-scale flexibility, the presence of defects and
long-range disorder, are not the exception, but rather the norm, in
metal-organic frameworks. Here we offer some perspective into how these
concepts are perhaps inescapably intertwined, highlight recent advances in our
understanding, and discuss how a consideration of the interfaces between them
may lead to enhancements of the materials' functionalities.

  Language Processing";"In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language
processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with
targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 150 hypothetical MOF structures
consisting of 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these
structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake
values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat
(Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to
identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a
classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is
identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 85.7%
and 86.7% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake,
respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored
to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies
of 88.4% and 80.7% across different classes for pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake
datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties
showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 89% for $H_{2}$ uptake,
respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF
search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing
for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the
complex landscape of MOFs.";;;;
http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00532v2;"Machine learning with persistent homology and chemical word embeddings
  improves prediction accuracy and interpretability in metal-organic frameworks";"Machine learning has emerged as a powerful approach in materials discovery.
Its major challenge is selecting features that create interpretable
representations of materials, useful across multiple prediction tasks. We
introduce an end-to-end machine learning model that automatically generates
descriptors that capture a complex representation of a material's structure and
chemistry. This approach builds on computational topology techniques (namely,
persistent homology) and word embeddings from natural language processing. It
automatically encapsulates geometric and chemical information directly from the
material system. We demonstrate our approach on multiple nanoporous
metal-organic framework datasets by predicting methane and carbon dioxide
adsorption across different conditions. Our results show considerable
improvement in both accuracy and transferability across targets compared to
models constructed from the commonly-used, manually-curated features,
consistently achieving an average 25-30% decrease in
root-mean-squared-deviation and an average increase of 40-50% in R2 scores. A
key advantage of our approach is interpretability: Our model identifies the
pores that correlate best to adsorption at different pressures, which
contributes to understanding atomic-level structure--property relationships for
materials design.";;;;

  data-driven materials design";"The Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS)
infrastructure at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
a large-scale collection of curated datasets and tools with more than 80000
materials and millions of properties. JARVIS uses a combination of electronic
structure, artificial intelligence (AI), advanced computation and experimental
methods to accelerate materials design. Here we report some of the new features
that were recently included in the infrastructure such as: 1) doubling the
number of materials in the database since its first release, 2) including more
accurate electronic structure methods such as Quantum Monte Carlo, 3) including
graph neural network-based materials design, 4) development of unified
force-field, 5) development of a universal tight-binding model, 6) addition of
computer-vision tools for advanced microscopy applications, 7) development of a
natural language processing tool for text-generation and analysis, 8) debuting
a large-scale benchmarking endeavor, 9) including quantum computing algorithms
for solids, 10) integrating several experimental datasets and 11) staging
several community engagement and outreach events. New classes of materials,
properties, and workflows added to the database include superconductors,
two-dimensional (2D) magnets, magnetic topological materials, metal-organic
frameworks, defects, and interface systems. The rich and reliable datasets,
tools, documentation, and tutorials make JARVIS a unique platform for modern
materials design. JARVIS ensures openness of data and tools to enhance
reproducibility and transparency and to promote a healthy and collaborative

http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19500v2;"Coarse-grained crystal graph neural networks for reticular materials
  design";"Reticular materials, including metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic
frameworks, combine relative ease of synthesis and an impressive range of
applications in various fields, from gas storage to biomedicine. Diverse
properties arise from the variation of building units$\unicode{x2013}$metal
centers and organic linkers$\unicode{x2013}$in almost infinite chemical space.
Such variation substantially complicates experimental design and promotes the
use of computational methods. In particular, the most successful artificial
intelligence algorithms for predicting properties of reticular materials are
atomic-level graph neural networks, which optionally incorporate domain
knowledge. Nonetheless, the data-driven inverse design involving these models
suffers from incorporation of irrelevant and redundant features such as full
atomistic graph and network topology. In this study, we propose a new way of
representing materials, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods;
the message passing is performed on a coarse-grained crystal graph that
comprises molecular building units. To highlight the merits of our approach, we
assessed predictive performance and energy efficiency of neural networks built
on different materials representations, including composition-based and
crystal-structure-aware models. Coarse-grained crystal graph neural networks
showed decent accuracy at low computational costs, making them a valuable
alternative to omnipresent atomic-level algorithms. Moreover, the presented
models can be successfully integrated into an inverse materials design pipeline
as estimators of the objective function. Overall, the coarse-grained crystal
graph framework is aimed at challenging the prevailing atom-centric perspective
on reticular materials design.";;;;

  conductive metal-organic frameworks with high-throughput structural and
  electronic properties";"The advent of pi-stacked layered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) opened up
new horizons for designing compact MOF-based devices as they offer unique
electrical conductivity on top of permanent porosity and exceptionally high
surface area. By taking advantage of the modular nature of these electrically
conductive (EC) MOFs, an unlimited number of materials can be created for
applications in electronic devices such as battery electrodes, supercapacitors,
and spintronics. Permutation of structural building blocks including different
metal nodes and organic linkers results in new systems with unprecedented and
unexplored physical and chemical properties. With the ultimate goal of
providing a platform for accelerated materials design and discovery, here, we
lay the foundations towards creation of the first comprehensive database of
EC-MOFs with an experimentally guided approach. The first phase of this
database, coined EC-MOF/Phase-I, is comprised of 1,061 bulk and mono-layer
structures built by all possible combinations of experimentally reported
organic linkers, functional groups and metal nodes. A high-throughput screening
(HTS) work flow is constructed to implement density functional theory
calculations with periodic boundary conditions to optimize the structures and
calculate some of their most significantly relevant properties. Since research
and development in the area of EC-MOFs has long been suffering from the lack of
appropriate initial crystal structures, all the geometries and property data
have been made available for the use of the community through the online
platform that is developed in the course of this work. This database provides
comprehensive physical and chemical data of EC-MOFs as well as convenience of
selecting appropriate materials for specific applications, thus, accelerating
design and discovery of EC-MOF-based compact devices.";;;;

evaluating materials for direct air capture of carbon dioxide (CO2),
specifically targeting novel metal organic framework materials. Our proposed
SMF is hierarchical, simultaneously addressing the most critical gaps in the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09184v1;"Rapid Design of Top-Performing Metal-Organic Frameworks with Qualitative
  Representations of Building Blocks";"Data-driven materials design often encounters challenges where systems
require or possess qualitative (categorical) information. Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) are an example of such material systems. The representation
of MOFs through different building blocks makes it a challenge for designers to
incorporate qualitative information into design optimization. Furthermore, the
large number of potential building blocks leads to a combinatorial challenge,
with millions of possible MOFs that could be explored through time consuming
physics-based approaches. In this work, we integrated Latent Variable Gaussian
Process (LVGP) and Multi-Objective Batch-Bayesian Optimization (MOBBO) to
identify top-performing MOFs adaptively, autonomously, and efficiently without
any human intervention. Our approach provides three main advantages: (i) no
specific physical descriptors are required and only building blocks that
construct the MOFs are used in global optimization through qualitative
representations, (ii) the method is application and property independent, and
(iii) the latent variable approach provides an interpretable model of
qualitative building blocks with physical justification. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we considered a design space with more than 47,000
MOF candidates. By searching only ~1% of the design space, LVGP-MOBBO was able
to identify all MOFs on the Pareto front and more than 97% of the 50
top-performing designs for the CO$_2$ working capacity and CO$_2$/N$_2$
selectivity properties. Finally, we compared our approach with the Random
Forest algorithm and demonstrated its efficiency, interpretability, and
robustness.";;;;
http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09251v2;Universal Machine Learning Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian for Materials;"While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational
approach in electronic structure calculations, its computational demands and
scalability limitations persist. Recently, leveraging neural networks to
parameterize the Kohn-Sham DFT Hamiltonian has emerged as a promising avenue
for accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements,
challenges such as the necessity for computing extensive DFT training data to
explore each new system and the complexity of establishing accurate ML models
for multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study
introduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian
matrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal
structures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in
predicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including
complex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\'e twisted
bilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we
utilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of
electronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940
crystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering
a reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this
universal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse
fields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and
also making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.";;;;
