Start by analyzing the initial query and then consider how the titles provided can enhance the context. Generate an improved query by adding one or more related terms, synonyms, or key variations that reflect a broader or more specific focus based on both the original query and the page titles. Your goal is to optimize the query for retrieving more relevant search results. This is the initial query : {}. And this is the three relevant page titles : {}.
