However, the potential of AI to work backwards, towards predicting/designing a finetuned material for a given separation, remains untapped. Recent works report the inverse design of functionalized materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but they are limited to targeted sorption properties, while diffusivity, D, which is the driving force in membrane-based separations, is omitted. Herein, we report a tool combining a biologically inspired evolutionary algorithm with machine learning to design fine-tuned Zeolitic-Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-family of MOFs, for desired sets of diffusivities (Di, Di/Dj) values of any given mixture of species i and j. We moreover display the efficacy of our tool, by designing ZIFs that meet industrial performance criteria of permeability and selectivity, for CO2/CH4, O2/N2 and C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. We validate the designed ZIFs through appropriate simulations, confirming the suitability of the AI-suggested ZIF designs.",0.8888756554133389,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 22:37:38.939064,False

Potential for Metal-Organic Frameworks","Machine-learned Potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling `quantum-accurate' potentials to linear time complexity. Yet, while they provide a more accurate reproduction of structural properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training dataset from \textit{ab initio} calculations. However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3,000 Zn-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations. More broadly, our contribution facilitates the development of general MLPs to accelerate chemical discoveries among other systems of interest at a fraction of the computational cost.

Building upon and extending the comparative analysis, our investigation underscores the CATBoost model's remarkable predictive prowess, characterized by a significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) and an enhanced R-squared (R²) value, thereby affirming its superior accuracy and reliability in forecasting CO2 adsorption. A pivotal aspect of our research is the integration of SHAP values for a detailed assessment of feature importance, which not only corroborated 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area' as pivotal determinants of CO2 uptake but also illuminated the model's advanced analytical capabilities in handling categorical features and mitigating overfitting, even within a dataset marked by intricate and non-linear patterns. Our quantitative and conceptual analysis, showcasing up to a 15% improvement in (RMSE) over previous models, reveals the CATBoost model’s unparalleled efficiency in discerning the multifaceted interplay of factors influencing CO2 adsorption. This is crucial for the strategic engineering of MOFs with optimized properties. Beyond 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area', our SHAP analysis highlighted other descriptors with substantial values, elucidating their nuanced contributions to CO2 uptake and providing invaluable insights for the MOF design process.

Owing to their high surface area, porosity, and tunability, MOFs have received significant attention for numerous applications such as gas separation and storage. Atomistic simulations and data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) have been successfully employed to screen large databases and successfully develop new experimentally synthesized and validated MOFs for CO2 capture. To enable data-driven materials discovery for any application, the first (and arguably most crucial) step is database curation. This work introduces the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC-MOF) database. This is a database of ~280,000 MOFs which have been either experimentally characterized or computationally generated, spanning all publicly available MOF databases. A key feature of ARC-MOF is that it contains DFT-derived electrostatic potential fitted partial atomic charges for each MOF. Additionally, ARC-MOF contains pre-computed descriptors for out-of-the-box machine learning applications. An in-depth analysis of the diversity of ARC-MOF with respect to the currently mapped design space of MOFs was performed – a critical, yet commonly overlooked aspect of previously reported MOF databases. Using this analysis, balanced subsets from ARC-MOF for various machine learning purposes have been identified.

The intrinsic length and time scales often stretch far beyond the nanometer and picosecond range due to e.g. large spatial heterogeneities or complex phase transitions. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can extend the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) towards such challenging systems,  but the generation of a representative training set of atomic configurations still poses a major challenge. In this work, we present an incremental learning scheme that constructs accurate and transferable MLPs based on a minimal number of DFT evaluations. Key to the approach is a combination of an active learning scheme that generates systematically improved MLPs with efficient and parallelized enhanced sampling protocols that explore increasingly larger portions of the phase space and learn physical interactions on-the-fly. The method requires a single atomic structure and a collective variable as input, after which the incremental learning approach constructs accurate interatomic potentials based on as few as 1000 single point DFT evaluations, even for flexible frameworks with multiple structurally different phases. The accuracy of the obtained potentials is extensively validated in terms of structural and mechanical properties across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, yielding thermodynamically transferable MLPs. Finally, it is demonstrated how the incremental learning approach shows great potential to train universal MLPs for a larger set of materials. A proof of principle based on 10 well-known aluminum- and zirconium-based MOFs is shown.

Despite noteworthy advancements over these 200 years, three areas remain recalcitrant to improvement owing to the environmental instability of the biomolecules used in vaccines—the challenges of formulating them into controlled release systems, their need for constant refrigeration to avoid loss of efficacy, and the requirement that they be delivered via needle owing to gastrointestinal incompatibility. Nanotechnology, particularly Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), has emerged as a promising avenue for confronting these challenges, presenting a new frontier in vaccine development. Although these materials have been widely explored in the context of drug delivery, imaging, and cancer immunotherapy, their role in immunology and vaccine-related applications is a recent yet rapidly developing field. This review seeks to elucidate the prospective use of MOFs and COFs for biomaterial stabilization, eliminating the necessity for cold chains, enhancing antigen potency as adjuvants, and potentializing needle-free delivery of vaccines.

In this study, we present a novel approach to further enhance the properties of porous polymer membranes emerging from MOFs through crosslinking of the organic linker molecules and subsequent metal-atom removal. To ensure reproducibility of the multi-step synthesis process and high quality of the resulting polymeric membranes, we automated the process and followed a machine learning optimization approach. The high-quality MOF-thin films (SURMOFs) were prepared in a layer-by-layer fashion directly on gold-coated porous alumina substrates. This direct synthesis proved crucial to preserve the structural integrity of the membranes and thus avoiding defect formation caused by a substrate-transfer process, which is usually required when advanced materials are used to fabricate a membrane. The initial SURMOF membrane exhibits moderate gas separation performance, once crosslinked, its gas selectivity could be significantly enhanced although with the compromise of lower gas permeance. Interestingly, once we removed the metal centers and thereby converted the SURMOF into a purely organic polymeric membrane, the membrane gas permeance could be restored almost to its initial condition while preserving the enhanced selectivities. In particular, the resulting polymeric membrane outperforms most commercially available polymer membranes for H2 /CO2 gas separation.

The presence of open metal sites (OMS) significantly influences the catalytic, adsorption, and separation capabilities of MOFs. However, common laboratory methods are indirect and can suffer from structural heterogeneity. Computational methods, including machine learning, play a central role in the rational design of MOFs, yet in silico detection of OMS still relies heavily on computationally expensive simulations. In this work, we use extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) and random forest (RF) methods to predict the existence of OMS in various MOF compounds based on structural and chemical features. RF provided a higher prediction accuracy of 0.891 compared to 0.865 of XGBoost. Average ionization energy, average electron affinity, and fraction of electrons in d orbitals exhibited the highest importance scores across the two models. These prediction models not only provide novel insights into the structural-property relationship between MOFs and OMS, but also would enable accurate and efficient exploration of MOFs that would give rise to OMS, facilitating the engineering of sorption, separation, and catalytic properties.

MFMs have a wide variety of potential and realised adsorption applications. In order to design an ideal framework material for a particular application, the composition of molecular fragments is not the only factor, but the arrangement of the those fragments is also important, especially when the fragments (molecular building blocks) are chemically functionalised and lack symmetry. As has been observed in Metal Organic Frameworks, the flexibility and absorption properties may differ greatly when altering the orientation of the building units or changing the position of functional groups. However, although the position of functional group has a great influence on a targeted property, studies on functional group arrangements have only been performed on a small set of MOF structures.

In this contribution, we develop a fingerprint/descriptor for optimising functionalised molecular framework structures using machine learning. We begin from  the  perspective of a molecular framework structure described as a collection of discrete pore shapes. To describe the chemical environment of the pore, we derive a fingerprint based on the occurrence of pairwise distances between functional groups in each pore. We present the possibilities of functional group arrangements in the 14 most common pore shapes, created by ditopic (2-connected) linkers are presented.

Traditional simulation approaches, such as molecular dynamics, are complex and computationally demanding. Although feature engineering-based machine learning methods perform better, they are susceptible to overfitting because of limited labeled data. Furthermore, these methods are typically designed for single tasks, such as predicting gas adsorption capacity under specific conditions, which restricts the utilization of comprehensive datasets including all adsorption capacities. To address these challenges, we propose Uni-MOF, an innovative framework for large-scale, three-dimensional MOF representation learning, designed for universal multi-gas prediction. Specifically, Uni-MOF serves as a versatile ""gas adsorption detector"" for MOF materials, employing pure three-dimensional representations learned from over 631,000 collected MOF and COF structures. Our experimental results show that Uni-MOF can automatically extract structural representations and predict adsorption capacities under various operating conditions using a single model.

However, their mechanical properties have not been systematically studied yet. Here, the machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) was developed to study the elastic properties of representative 2D COFs, e.g., COF-1 and COF-5. The trained NEP enables one to study the mechanical properties of 2D COFs in realistic situations (e.g., finite size and temperature) and enjoys greatly improved computational efficiency as compared with density functional theory calculations. With the aid of the obtained NEP, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with the strain fluctuation method were employed to evaluate the elastic constants of the considered 2D COFs at different temperatures. The elastic constants of COF-1 and COF-5 monolayers are found to decrease with growing temperature, though they are almost isotropic, irrespective of the temperature. The thermally induced softening of 2D COFs below a critical temperature is majorly attributed to their inherent ripple configurations at finite temperatures, while, above the critical temperature, the damping effect of anharmonic vibrations becomes the dominant factor.

This quantification allows us to use techniques from ecology to analyse the chemical diversity of these materials in terms of diversity metrics. In particular, we show that this diversity analysis can identify biases in the databases, and how such bias can lead to incorrect conclusions.

In this case, the role of membrane-based separation cannot be neglected since, compared with other conventional process, membrane-based process is more effective and consumes less energy. Regarding this, metal-based membranes, particularly palladium, are usually employed for hydrogen separation because of its high selectivity. However, with the advancement of various microporous materials, they could challenge the status quo of the metal-based membranes since they could offer both high hydrogen permeability and selectivity while also relatively cheaper to be produced. In this article, the advancement of five main microporous material membranes, namely silica-based membranes, zeolite membranes, carbon-based membranes, metal organic frameworks/covalent organic frameworks (MOF/COF) membranes and microporous polymeric membranes are extensively discussed.

solids with tunable structures that make it possible to impart specific
chemical functionality tailored for a given application. However, the enormous
number of possible MOFs that can be synthesized makes it difficult to determine
which materials would be the most promising candidates, especially for
applications governed by electronic structure properties that are often
computationally demanding to simulate and time-consuming to probe
experimentally. Here, we have developed the first publicly available quantum-chemical
database for MOFs (the “QMOF database”), which consists of properties derived
from density functional theory (DFT) for over 14,000 experimentally synthesized
MOFs. Throughout this study, we demonstrate how this new database can be used
to identify MOFs with targeted electronic structure properties. As a
proof-of-concept, we use the QMOF database to evaluate the performance of
several machine learning models for the prediction of DFT-computed band gaps

achieving superior predictive performance, making it possible to circumvent
computationally expensive quantum-chemical calculations. We also show how
unsupervised learning methods can aid the discovery of otherwise subtle structure–property
relationships using the computational findings in this work. We conclude by
highlighting several MOFs with low band gaps, a challenging task given the
electronically insulating nature of most MOF structures. The data and
predictive models generated in this work, as well as the database of MOF

Molecular crystal engineering is generally incapable of producing precisely spaced arrays of molecules for use in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and sensors. A promising alternative strategy is the incorporation of chromophores into crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to matrix coordination-induced emission (MCIE) upon confinement. However, it remains unclear how the precise arrangement of chromophores and defects dictates photophysical properties in these systems, limiting the rational design of well-defined photoluminescent materials. Herein, we report new, robust Zr-based MOFs constructed from the linker tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)ethylene (TCPE4−) that exhibit an unexpected structural transition in combination with a prominent shift from green to blue photoluminescence (PL) as a function of the amount of acid modulator (benzoic, formic, or acetic acid) used during synthesis. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements provide full spectral information and reveal that the observed hypsochromic shift arises due to a higher concentration of linker substitution defects at higher modulator concentrations, leading to broader excitation transfer-induced spectral diffusion. Spectral diffusion of this type has not been reported in a MOF to date, and its observation provides structural information that is otherwise unobtainable using traditional crystallographic techniques.

As demonstrations, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data with 13,506 MOF structures at 100 bar and 243 K is used as the source task.

Based on further analysis, transfer learning will always work on the target tasks with low generalizability.

common perception of MOF structures being static. Structural dynamics in MOFs, however,
typically refers to the “breathing” behavior of pore cavities and the transient binding of guest
molecules, but dynamic bonding would explain important MOF phenomena in catalysis, post-
synthetic exchange, negative thermal expansion, and crystal growth. Here, we demonstrate through
use of variable-temperature diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (VT-
DRIFTS) aided by ab initio plane wave density function theory, that similar evidence for melting
behavior in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be observed for carboxylate MOFs by
monitoring the red-shifts of carboxylate stretches coupled to anharmonic metal-carboxylate
oscillators. To demonstrate the generality of these findings, we investigate a wide class of
carboxylate MOFs that includes iconic examples with diverse structures and metal-linker
chemistry. As the very vibrations invoked in ZIF melting, but heretofore unobserved for
carboxylate MOFs, these metal-linker dynamics resemble the ubiquitous soft modes that trigger
important phase transitions in diverse classes of materials, while offering a fundamentally new

To achieve this, we trained our neural network only on alchemical species, represented only by their geometry and force field parameters, and used this neural network to predict the loadings of real adsorbates. We focused on predicting room temperature adsorption of small (one- and two-atom) molecules relevant to chemical separations. Namely, argon, krypton, xenon, methane, ethane, and nitrogen. However, we also observed surprisingly promising predictions for more complex molecules, whose properties are outside the range spanned by the alchemical adsorbates. Prediction accuracies suitable for large-scale screening were achieved using simple MOF (e.g. geometric properties and chemical moieties), and adsorbate (e.g. forcefield parameters and geometry) descriptors. Our results illustrate a new philosophy of training that opens the path towards development of machine learning models that can predict the adsorption loading of any new adsorbate at any new operating conditions in any new MOF.</div>",0.8590658573911926,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 22:38:01.225503,False

However, it remains a significant challenge to experimentally realize new materials that are predicted. In this study, we propose a novel materials design strategy that utilizes machine-learning (ML) techniques to predict new porous materials that show promise for hydrogen storage and are likely to be feasible to synthesize. By leveraging ML techniques and metal−organic framework (MOF) databases, we are able to predict the synthesizability of MOF structures. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a new vanadium-based MOF that exhibits excellent performance for cryogenic H2 storage.

Compared to other drug delivery systems, state-of-the-art MOFs can encapsulate up to 50 times higher quantities of drugs per unit of mass while showing very long release times. Nevertheless, for their translation into clinical applications, concerns regarding MOF biocompatibility necessitate comprehensive mitigation. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time-intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a novel computational pipeline guided by machine learning (ML) for probing the biocompatibility of MOFs. The pipeline is designed to expedite the assessment of potential MOF toxicity based on the chemical properties of their precursors. Interpretable ML models were built on a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, predicting the potential toxicity of MOF linkers with 83% accuracy. Additionally, we established a comprehensive database cataloging the toxicity of MOF metallic centers. Leveraging these, we have screened the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) containing 86,000 non-disordered MOFs, identifying existing and future promising candidates with minimal toxicity profiles for drug delivery applications. Beyond high-throughput screening, the developed models shed light on the chemical landscape associated with high biocompatibility precursor molecules, enabling the derivation of guidelines for the rational design of biocompatible MOFs. This framework thus expedites the identification of biocompatible materials, while facilitating deeper insights into their underlying chemistry.

In this study, we designed a database of ~20,000 hypothetical MOFs which are diverse in terms of their chemical design space—metal nodes, organic linkers, functional groups and pore geometries. Using Machine Learning techniques, we visualized and quantified the diversity of these structures. We find that on adding the structures of our database, the overall diversity metrics of hypothetical databases improve, especially in terms of the chemistry of metal nodes. We then assessed the usefulness of diverse structures by evaluating their performance, using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, in two important environmental applications—post combustion carbon capture and hydrogen storage. We find that many of these structures perform better than widely used benchmark materials such as Zeolite-13X (for post combustion carbon capture) and MOF-5 (for hydrogen storage).",0.8637067191498756,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 22:38:02.520253,False

Replacing current cryogenic distillation units with adsorption separation units, especially for the minor component of ethane, would enable significant efficiency gains. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are well-suited for adsorption separation due to their high surface areas and tunable chemical properties; exploring all possible MOFs is a daunting experimental challenge, motivating in silico screening with machine learning models. We present a database of 948 experimentally measured pure-component C2 isotherms from 192 MOFs gathered from the literature and use it to train machine learning models to predict MOF ethane and ethylene uptake across a range of temperature and pressure conditions. The models have high accuracy in interpolative tasks (mean absolute error ~0.05 mmol/g) when trained on only 20% of available data. Performance on unseen structures was also reasonably accurate with MAEs ~0.7 mmol/g. We apply the models to screen the CoRE ASR 2019 database and identify the most promising candidates. Several MOFs containing lanthanide metals were predicted to have high ethane selectivity, suggesting that this class of MOFs may be worth further investigation. Feature importance analysis suggests that MOF SBU design and optimizing the process conditions at which the sorbent will operate are critical for enabling ethane-selective separation.

However, these experiments induce a net flux of counter ions, resulting in an electric field and transport by electromigration, which can impair the accuracy of the measurement. To remedy this, we employ an alternative method based on steady-state cyclic voltammetry. By adding a mobile redox acceptor molecule to the electrolyte, the additional cross reaction between the film and the acceptor mimics a source-drain electrode configuration, generating a steady state with negligible counter ion flux. Additionally, we construct a bespoke physical model and derive an analytical expression to correct the current response for any electric field effects. Overall, this method effectively isolates the diffusional response from ionic diffusion-migration and electric field effects.

They are well known for their porosity, large surface area, and related properties. The electronic properties of most MOFs and COFs are the superposition of those of their constituting building blocks.

Consequently, it is useful to predict whether a MOF is water-stable before investing time and resources into synthesis. Existing heuristics for designing water-stable MOFs lack generality and artificially limit the diversity of explored chemistry due to narrowly defined criteria. Machine learning (ML) models offer the promise to improve generality of predictions but require diverse experimental MOF stability data to be trained. In an improvement on previous efforts, we enlarge the available training data for MOF water stability prediction by over 400%, adding 911 MOFs with water stability labels assigned through semi-automated manuscript analysis to curate the new data set WS24. The additional data is shown to improve ML model performance (test ROC-AUC > 0.8) over diverse chemistry for the prediction of both water stability and stability in harsher acidic conditions. We illustrate how the expanded data set and models can be used with previously developed activation stability models to carry out genetic algorithms to quickly screen ~10,000 MOFs from a space of hundreds of thousands for candidates with multivariate stability (i.e., for activation, in water, and in acid).

Following the publication of the melting mechanism of zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-4, we use here molecular simulation in order to investigate the similarities and differences with two other zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, ZIF-8 and ZIF-zni.

In this work, to improve our understanding of the factors influencing melting, the thermal response of four closely related zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) was studied. Electron withdrawing ligands were found to lower both the melting and glass transition temperatures, providing a promising strategy for improving the processability of MOFs in the liquid state.

Sorption processes are typically modeled by means of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. However, GCMC methods are limited to physisorption processes described by molecular-mechanics, or, classical, interatomic potentials. Therefore, a computationally efficient GCMC method that accounts for chemisorption is needed. Here, we report hybrid interatomic potentials that are specifically designed for GCMC simulations of chemisorption. Namely, the sorbate-sorbate interaction is described by classical potentials and the sorbate-sorbent interaction is rendered by a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on simulation data extracted from quantum calculations. To prove the principal, we have applied the method to the simulation of \ce{CO2} chemisorption in the porous metal-organic framework Mg-MOF-74. By comparing the GCMC simulated \ce{CO2} adsorption isotherms and isobars, respectively, with the experimental data, we obtain better agreement compared to other classical and quantum-chemical simulation methods while keeping computational cost at a minimum. With the rise of transferable MLIP, we expect that the method could enable computationally efficient and highly accurate sorption studies in reticular materials.

Due to the inherent difficulty to determine the atomistic structure of amorphous glasses, the intrinsic structural porosity of MOF glasses is only poorly understood. In this work, the porosity features of a series of prototypical MOF glass formers from the family of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and their corresponding glasses is investigated comprehensively. CO2 gas sorption at 195 K allows to follow the evolution of microporosity when transforming from the crystalline to the glassy state of these materials. Based on these data, the pore volume and the apparent density of the ZIF glasses (i.e. the density including the intrinsic microporosity of the glasses) are quantified for the first time. Additional hydrocarbon sorption data (n-butane, propane and propylene) at variable temperatures together with X-ray total scattering experiments prove that the porosity features (in particular the pore size and the pore limiting diameter) of the ZIF glasses depend on the types of organic linkers present in the glass network. This allows formulating first design principles for a targeted tuning of the intrinsic microporosity of MOF glasses. Importantly, these principles are counterintuitive and contrary to established porosity design concepts for crystalline MOFs but show similarities to strategies previously developed for porous polymers.

Tailoring Sol-gel Ceramic Mesoporous Coatings on Labile Metal-organic Frameworks through Kinetic Control.,"Surface engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a mesoporous silica coating can improve MOF mechanical properties and provide an easy way to decorate MOF nanoparticles with organic or biological molecules though silane chemistry or electrostatic interactions, while retaining open access to MOF porosity. Silica coating would be highly beneficial for employing MOFs in a wide range of applications such as catalysis or drug delivery. However, obtaining a stable, controlled core-shell structure using MOF nanoparticles as seed is challenging because of their intrinsic chemically labile nature. Here we analyze the factors that destabilize the core of the Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) MOFs during the sol-gel deposition of a mesoporous silica shell causing a partial or total etching of the MOF material. Silicates in solution are found to scavenge Zn2+ ions removing them from the ZIF structure and causing a partial or complete dissolution of the ZIF seed. By carefully tuning the silicate concentration in solution simultaneous control can be obtained over both the ZIF-8 dissolution and the silica condensation kinetics, resulting in the growth of a uniform mesoporous silica shell while preserving the integrity of ZIF-8. The core-shell nanoparticles obtained show a compact core shell structure with no gap between the MOF core and the silica shell, even after calcination, while the crystalline ZIF-8 structure is retained. Overall, a general synthetic approach is presented for producing nanocomposite core-shell materials which can be applied to other MOF labile seed to design new hierarchical materials.",0.8544654549537068,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 22:38:19.357050,False

However, navigating this chemical space to identify optimal MOF structures poses a significant challenge. Tradtional high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), while useful, is often limited by a distribution bias towards materials not aligned with the desired functionalities. To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a ”deep dreaming” methodology to optimise MOFs in silico, aiming to generate structures with systematically shifted properties that are closer to target functionalities from the outset. Our methodology

Synthesis of the MOF in the presence of a fluorophore enables the capture and dispersal of dye molecules within the ZIF-8 framework. Within the resulting supramolecular assemblies, the fluorophore components show excellent photophysical properties such as high emission and increased fluorescence lifetime, despite the tendency of the dye to undergo aggregation-caused quenching in the solid-state, as well as a 4-fold enhancement of the fluorophore’s photostability. The demonstration that supramolecular events can be invoked to construct solid fluorescent systems from separate components is realized. The encapsulation of the fluorescein in an enclosed subunit of the ZIF-8 framework was modelled using the density-functional tight-binding method. Furthermore, the fluorophore@MOF composite can be internalized by mammalian macrophage cells and transported to lysosomes without disrupting cell viability.

Chemists have developed several theories to predict the oxidation state on the basis of the chemical formula.

In this work, we present a data-driven approach to automatically assign oxidation states, using a machine learning algorithm trained on the assignments by chemists encoded in the chemical names in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. Our approach only considers the immediate local chemical environment around a metal centre and, in this way, is robust to most of the experimental uncertainties in these structures (like incorrect protonation or unbound solvents). We find such excellent accuracy (> 98 %) in our predictions that we can use our method to identify a large number of incorrect assignments in the database. The predictions of our model follow chemical intuition, without explicitly having taught the model those heuristics.

Given an adsorption task, we often wish to search a library of NPMs for the one with the optimal adsorption property. The high cost of NPM synthesis and gas adsorption measurements, whether these experiments are in the lab or in a simulation, often precludes exhaustive search.

We explain, demonstrate, and advocate Bayesian optimization (BO) to actively search for the optimal NPM in a library of NPMs-- and find it using the fewest experiments. The two ingredients of BO are a surrogate model and an acquisition function. The surrogate model is a probabilistic model reflecting our beliefs about the NPM-structure--property relationship based on observations from past experiments. The acquisition function uses the surrogate model to score each NPM according to the utility of picking it for the next experiment. It balances two competing goals: (a) exploitation of our current approximation of the structure-property relationship to pick the highest-performing NPM, and (b) exploration of blind spots in the NPM space to pick an NPM we are uncertain about, to improve our approximation of the structure-property relationship. We demonstrate BO by searching an open database of ~70,000 hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the COF with the highest simulated methane deliverable capacity. BO finds the optimal COF and acquires 30% of the top 100 highest-ranked COFs after evaluating only ~120 COFs.

As a strength, HTE excels at being able to find interesting and novel catalytic activity; any a priori theoretical approach would be hard-pressed to find success, as high-performing catalysts required highly specific operating conditions difficult to model theoretically, and initial naïve single-atom models of the active site did not prove representative of the nanoparticle catalysts responsible for conversion to hexadiene.

To aid discovery of porous molecular crystals for desired applications, energy-structure-function (ESF) maps were developed that combine a priori prediction of both the crystal structure and its functional properties. However, it is a challenge to represent the high-dimensional structural and functional landscapes of an ESF map and to identify energetically favourable and functionally interesting polymorphs among the 1,000s-10,000s of structures typically on a single ESF map. Here, we introduce geometric landscapes, a representation for ESF maps based on geometric similarity, quantified by persistent homology. We show that this representation allows the exploration of complex ESF maps, automatically pinpointing interesting crystalline phases available to the molecule. Furthermore, we show that geometric landscapes can serve as an accountable descriptor for porous materials to predict their performance for gas adsorption applications.

They are  intriguing platforms for the design of porous skeletons with special functionality at the molecular level. However, despite their extraordinary properties, it is difficult to control their electronic properties, thus hindering the potential implementation in electronic devices. A new form of nanoporous material, COFs intercalated with first row transition metal is proposed to address this fundamental drawback - the lack of electronic tunability. Using first-principles calculations, we have designed 31 new COF materials <i>in-silico</i> by intercalating all of the first row transition metals (TMs) with boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs: COF-TM-x (where TM=Sc-Zn and x=3-5). This is a significant addition considering that only 187 experimentally COFs structures has been reported and characterized so far. We have investigated their structure and electronic properties. Specifically, we predict that COF's band gap and density of states (DOSs) can be controlled by intercalating first row transition metal atoms (TM: Sc - Zn) and fine tuned by the concentration of TMs. We also found that the $d$-subshell electron density of the TMs plays the main role in determining the electronic properties of the COFs. Thus intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to control the electronic properties of materials within a porous network. This work opens up new avenues for the design of TM-intercalated materials with promising future applications in nanoporous electronic devices, where a high surface area coupled with fine-tuned electronic properties are desired.</div>",0.851824214277642,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:39:13.421280,False

The overwhelming majority of the studies is focused on propylene/propane separation. Nevertheless, as the ultimate goal is to obtain propylene as the end product, propylene-selective MOFs necessitate a demanding and complex desorption process, which consumes a substantial amount of energy and involves intricate operations. Consequently, having an adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs propane instead would be more advantageous. This approach would enable the production of high-purity propylene in a single step and lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and the quantity of adsorbent required. The Computation-Ready Experimental Metal-Organic Framework (CoRE MOF) 2019 database is utilized for the computational screening of flexible MOFs using molecular dynamics simulations to identify materials with strong potential for separating propane/propylene via self-diffusion. This screening process is the first to fully consider the impact of framework flexibility on the discovery of guest self-diffusion coefficients. The study underscores the significance of accounting for framework flexibility in investigations of gas molecules transport in MOFs, showcases the potential of using data-driven approaches to identify high-performance materials, and suggests methods for enhancing the predictive capabilities of screening workflows.  The top 5 MOFs from the CoRE MOF database for propane and propylene separation at a temperature of 298 K are identified. It is observed that the presence of carbonyl groups greatly enhances the separation properties between propane and propylene. Subsequently, a machine learning approach is utilized to develop a model and uncover important features.

Here, we present a general process for the shaping and densifying of COFs into centimetre-scale porous monolithic pellets without the need for templates, additives or binders. This process minimises mechanical damage from shear-induced plastic deformation and further provides a network of interparticle mesopores that we exploit in accessing analyte capacities above those achievable from the intrinsic porosity of the COF framework.

However, to date only flexible cross-linkers were used in the MOF crosslinking approach, since a rigid cross-linker would require an ideal fit between the MOF structure

cross-linker inside the MOF structures. In a second, independent step, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations we quantitatively confirmed all matches provided by
the screening. Our approach thus provides a robust and powerful method to identify
ideal MOF/Cross-linker combinations, which helped to identify several MOF-to-COF

The predictable design and structural modularity of these materials make them promising candidates for applications including catalysis, environmental remediation, chemical separations, and organic electronics, many of which will require stability to mechanical and thermal stress. Based on their reinforced structures and high degradation temperatures as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), many reports have claimed that COFs have excellent thermal stability. However, their stability to heat and pressure has not been probed using methods that report on structural changes rather than the loss of volatile compounds. Here we explore two structurally analogous 2D COFs with different polymerization chemistries using in operando X-ray diffraction, which demonstrates the loss of crystallinity at lower temperatures than the degradation temperatures measured by TGA. Density functional theory calculations suggest that an asymmetric buckling of the COF lattice is responsible for the observed loss of crystallinity. In addition to their thermal stability, x-ray diffraction of the 2D COFs under gas pressures up to 100 bar showed no loss in crystallinity or structural changes, indicating that these materials are robust to mechanical stress by applied pressure.

we implemented the possibility to use periodic reference data in order to prevent the
difficulty of generating representative finite clusters. Second, a more efficient global
optimizer based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES)
was employed during the parameterization process. We confirmed that CMA-ES, as
a state-of-the-art black box optimizer for problems on continuous variables, is more
suitable for force field optimization than the previous genetic algorithm. The obtained

effort was spent to ensure that the FF is able to describe the crucial linker swing effect
in a large number of ZIF-8 derivatives. For this reason we compared our force field to ab initio molecular dynamic simulations and found an accuracy comparable to those

Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt-quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases.

They were given the freedom to choose which MOF to synthesize and use for capture of either methylene blue or iodine. This hands-on experience exposed students to techniques not typically explored in general chemistry, including the use of crystallographic information files to examine MOF structures, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. At the end of the term, students presented their work during a formal poster session where they received valuable feedback from faculty and graduate students at Oregon State University. Additionally, students participated in a survey to provide feedback on the learning outcomes of this new experiment, in which they expressed their interest in further exploring MOFs in the future.

Out of the many molecular simulation methods that exist to model these disordered materials, one strategy consists in simulating the phase transition from a crystalline MOF to the amorphous state using molecular dynamics. ReaxFF reactive force fields have been proposed for this purpose in several studies to generate models of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) glasses by melt-quenching. In this work, we investigate in detail the accuracy and reliability of this approach by reproducing the published procedures and comparing the structure of the resulting glasses to other data, including ab initio modeling. We find that the in silico melt-quench procedure is extremely sensitive to the choice of methodology and parameters, and suggest adaptations to improve the scheme. We also show that the glass models generated with ReaxFF are markedly different from their ab initio counterparts, as well as known experimental characteristics, and feature an unphysical description of the local coordination environment, which in term affects the medium-range and bulk properties.",0.8531094145310301,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:40:10.140937,False

Understanding and predicting gas adsorption within porous materials demands comprehensive computational simulations that are often resource intensive, limiting the identification of promising materials. Active learning (AL) methods offer an effective strategy to reduce the computational burden by selectively acquiring critical data for model training. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit immense potential across various adsorption applications due to their porous structure and their modular nature, leading to diverse pore sizes and chemistry that serve as an ideal platform to develop adsorption models. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of AL in predicting gas adsorption within MOFs using “alchemical” molecules and their interactions as surrogates for real molecules. We first applied AL separately to each MOF, reducing the training dataset size by 57.5% while retaining predictive accuracy. Subsequently, we amalgamated the refined datasets across 1800 MOFs to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, successfully predicting adsorption of real molecules. Furthermore, by integrating MOF features into the AL framework using principal component analysis (PCA), we navigated MOF space effectively, achieving high predictive accuracy with only a subset of MOFs. Our results highlight AL's efficiency in reducing dataset size, enhancing model performance, and offering insights into adsorption phenomenon in large datasets of MOFs.

Further, these drugs are often delivered via injection, which requires skilled medical personnel and produces biohazardous waste. Here, we report an approach that allows for the controlled delivery of DNA and protein therapeutics to allow for either burst or slow-release kinetics without altering the formulation; further, we show we can deliver these materials into the tissues of very different organisms without the use of needles. We show that biomaterials encapsulated within the highly porous metal-organic Framework ZIF-8 are stable as a powder formulation that can be shot into tissue with a low-cost gas-powered “MOF-Jet” for direct delivery into living tissues of plants and animals and the release of the biomaterials can be controlled by judiciously choosing the compressed gas used in the gun. Many MOFs, including ZIF-8, are acid labile and readily dissolve at low pH. When CO2 is used as the carrier gas to shoot MOFs into moist tissue, we show that we can create a transient and weakly acidic local environment that causes the near-instantaneous release of the biomolecules. Conversely, when air is used, the MOF is delivered into tissue and degrades slowly over a week, releasing biomolecules. This innovation represents the first example of biolistic-mediated controlled delivery of biomolecules with ZIF-8 and provides a powerful tool for fundamental and applied plant and animal sciences research.",0.85426033519645,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:40:22.721271,False

different crystal packing arrangements. Similarly, the use of different solvents for crystallisation,

Modularly synthesized classes of NPMs, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offer a large number of candidate structures for each adsorption task. A complete NPM-property table, containing measurements of the relevant adsorption properties in the candidate NPMs, would enable the matching of NPMs with adsorption tasks. However, in practice the NPM-property matrix is only partially observed (incomplete); (i) many properties of any given NPM have not been measured and (ii) any given property has not been measured for all NPMs.<br /><br />The idea in this work is to leverage the observed (NPM, property) values to impute the missing ones. Similarly, commercial recommendation systems impute missing entries in an incomplete item-customer ratings matrix to recommend items to customers. We demonstrate a COF recommendation system to match COFs with adsorption tasks by training a low rank model of an incomplete COF--adsorption-property matrix. A low rank model, trained on the observed (COF, adsorption property) values, provides (i) predictions of the missing (COF, adsorption property) values and (ii) a ""map"" of COFs, represented as points, wherein COFs with similar (dissimilar) adsorption properties congregate (separate). We find the performance of the COF recommendation system varies for different adsorption tasks and diminishes precipitously when the fraction of missing entries exceeds 60%.

To provide a more comprehensive description of the behavior of the hydrocarbon molecules within the MOF-74 cavity, diffusion processes and corresponding diffusion barriers of small hydrocarbons in the MOF-74-Mg were modeled. This work provides a description of the molecular transport processes of CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 within and along the cavity of MOF-74-Mg; in addition, the influence of pre-adsorbed water molecules is also addressed. Density functional theory (DFT), as implemented within a plane-wave (PW) approach under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), has been used to investigate the diffusion mechanisms using the climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method, coupled with the van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) and ultra-soft pseudopotentials. Two transport mechanisms were identified: M1, referring to the molecular migrations within the MOF cavity; and M2, referring to the molecular migrations along the MOF longitudinal channel. The M1 transport mechanism was further analyzed to address the molecular migration from one metal atom to its adjacent one (M1a), and with respect to the second metal over (M1b). All the transport mechanisms considered show that the diffusion of paraffin molecules in MOF-74-Mg is energetically more favorable than that of olefin molecules. An interesting trend is observed across all the diffusion mechanisms where the stronger the molecule binds to the open metal site, the higher the diffusion barrier it needs to overcome. For all the small hydrocarbons considered in this study, transport mechanism M1a is significantly more energetically favorable than M1b, showing that it is easier for molecules to drift along the longitudinal cavity than to remain trapped cross-sectionally within the cavity itself. This work shows how this computational approach can be successfully applied not only to reveal the molecular transport in other MOF-74 isostructural species, but also in the fundamental understanding of the screening of MOFs and other nano-porous materials for gas separation applications.",0.8626658775243384,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:40:28.039545,False

by ball-milling results in significant enhancement of the composite stability,
reflecting in persistent and stable ionic conductivity during exposure to
ambient air over up to 20 days. While the introduction of network disorder
decelerates IL exudation and interactions with ambient contaminants, the ion
conductivity is only marginally affected, decreasing linearly with decreasing
crystallinity but still maintaining superionic behavior. This highlights the

catalysts. Given that reactants, or potentially holes/electrons, need to
diffuse into the porous framework as the reaction proceeds, the reaction can
possibly take place within the bulk of the particle or be confined to a thin
layer at the surface due to transport limitations. Herein, a simple
steady-state reaction-diffusion kinetic model is developed to diagnose these
two mutually exclusive behaviors in MOF-based systems. The oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) driven by a chemical oxidant is presented as an example
mechanism. Quantitative metrics for assigning either bulk or surface reactivity
are delineated over a wide variety of conditions, and numerical simulations are

However, most chemical discovery efforts use computational study of hypothetical MOFs without consideration of their stability, limiting the practical application of novel materials. We overcome this limitation by screening hypothetical ultrastable MOFs that have predicted high thermal and activation stability, as judged by machine learning (ML) models trained on experimental measures of stability. We enhance this set by computing the bulk modulus as a measure of mechanical stability and filter 1,102 mechanically robust hypothetical MOFs from a database of ultrastable MOFs (USMOF DB). Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to examine the gas adsorption properties of these hypothetical MOFs, alongside a database of experimental MOFs. We identify privileged building blocks that allow MOFs in USMOF DB to show exceptional working capacities compared to the experimental MOFs. We interpret these differences by training ML models on CO2 and CH4 adsorption in these databases, showing how poor model transferability between datasets indicates that novel design rules can be derived from USMOF DB that would not have been gathered through assessment of structurally characterized MOFs.

The performance and suitability of nanoporous materials for each specific application are directly related to both its physical and chemical properties, and their determination is crucial for process engineering and optimization of performances. In this Account, we focus on some recent developments in the multi-scale modeling of physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, highlighting the latest advances in three specific areas: mechanical properties, thermal properties, and adsorption. For the study of the mechanical behavior of nanoporous materials, the last few years have seen a rapid acceleration of research. For example, computational resources have been pooled to created public large-scale databases of elastic constants: those can serve as a basis for data-based discovery of materials with targeted properties, as well as the training of machine learning predictor models. The large-scale prediction of thermal behavior, in comparison, is not yet routinely performed at such large scale. Tentative databases have been assembled at the DFT level on specific families of materials, like zeolites, but prediction at larger scale currently requires the use of transferable, classical force fields, whose accuracy can be limited. Finally, adsorption is naturally one of the most studied physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, as fluid separation or storage is often the primary target for these materials. We highlight the recent achievements and open challenges for adsorption prediction at large scale, focusing in particular on the accuracy of computational models and the reliability of comparisons with experimental data available. We detail some recent methodological improvements in the prediction of adsorption-related properties, including thermodynamic quantities and transport properties. Finally, we stress the importance for data-based methods of addressing all sources of uncertainty.

In these materials, the structural differences of the ligands used in the synthesis are sufficiently subtle that they can each occupy the same site in the framework. However, multivariate or ligand scrambling approaches are rarely used in the synthesis of porous metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) – the molecular equivalent of MOFs – despite the potential to retain a unique intrinsic pore from the individual cage while varying the extrinsic porosity of the material. Herein we directly synthesise scrambled cages across two families of lantern-type MOPs and find contrasting effects on their gas sorption properties. In one family, the scrambling approach sees a gradual increase in the BET surface area with the maximum and minimum uptakes associated with the two pure homoleptic cages. In the other, the scrambled materials display improved surface areas with respect to both of the original, homoleptic cages. Through analysis of the gas sorption isotherms, we attribute this effect to the balance of micro- and mesoporosity with the materials.

For example, over 5,000 new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were reported in the past year alone. While these materials are often synthesized for specific applications, they may have potential uses in entirely different domains. However, identifying the best applications for new materials remains a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate a multimodal approach that uses the information available as soon as a MOF is synthesized, specifically its powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) and the chemicals used in its synthesis, to predict its potential properties and uses. By self-supervised pretraining of this model on crystal structures accessible from MOF databases, our model achieves accurate predictions for various properties, across pore structure, chemistry-reliant, and quantum-chemical properties. We further assess the robustness of this method in the presence of experimental measurement imperfections. Utilizing this approach, we create a synthesis-to-application map for MOFs, offering insights into optimal material classes for diverse applications. Finally, by augmenting this model with a recommendation system, we identify promising MOFs for applications that are different from the originally reported applications.

Advanced computer simulations reveal that, due to their similar interactions with the frame- work, H2O and CO2 molecules compete for the same binding sites, occupying similar void regions within the CALF-20 pores. This competition results in distinct thermodynamic and dynamical behavior of H2O and CO2 molecules, depending on whether one or both guest species are present. Notably, the presence of CO2 molecules forces the H2O molecules to form more connected hydrogen-bond networks within smaller regions, slowing water reorien- tation dynamics and decreasing water entropy. Conversely, the presence of water speeds up the reorientation of CO2 molecules, decreases CO2 entropy, and increases the propensity for CO2 to be adsorbed within the framework due to stronger water-mediated interactions. Due to the competition for the same void spaces, both H2O and CO2 molecules exhibit slower diffusion when molecules of the other guest species are present.

Thousands of MOFs have been synthesized, yet relatively few have been screened for their promise in methane conversion. We developed a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) workflow that identifies MOFs from a diverse space of experimental MOFs that have not been studied for catalysis, yet are thermally stable, synthesizable, and have promising unsaturated metal sites for C–H activation via a terminal metal-oxo species. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical rebound mechanism for methane to methanol conversion on models of the secondary building units (SBUs) from 87 selected MOFs. While we showed that oxo formation favorability decreases with increasing 3d filling, consistent with prior work, previously observed scaling relations between oxo formation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are disrupted by the greater diversity in our MOF set. Accordingly, we focused on Mn MOFs, which favor oxo intermediates without disfavoring HAT or leading to high methanol release energies—a key feature for methane hydroxylation activity. We identified three Mn MOFs comprising unsaturated Mn centers bound to weak-field carboxylate ligands in planar or bent geometries with promising methane to methanol kinetics and thermodynamics. The energetic spans of these MOFs are indicative of promising turnover frequencies for methane to methanol that warrant further experimental catalytic studies.",0.8551988727821014,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:41:44.027192,False

However, current methods heavily rely on experience and domain knowledge, which not only proves tedious but also is hard to keep up with the pace of data acquisition. In this context, we introduce a transferable Vision Transformer (ViT) model for identification of materials from their spectra, including XRD and FTIR. First, an optimal ViT model was trained to predict metal organic frameworks (MOFs) from their XRD spectra. It attains prediction accuracies of 70%, 93%, and 94.9% for Top-1, Top-3, and Top-5, respectively, and a shorter training time of 269 seconds in comparison to a convolutional neural network model. The dimension reduction and attention weight map underline its adeptness at capturing relevant features in the XRD spectra for determining the prediction outcome. Moreover, the model can be transferred to a new one for prediction of organic molecules from their FTIR spectra, attaining remarkable Top-1, Top-3, and Top-5 prediction accuracies of 84%, 94.1%, and 96.7%, respectively.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in general domains, they still face significant challenges when applied to specialized problems in fields like materials science. In this study, we enhance the performance of LLMs in the specific field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage by employing a post-pretraining approach to customize the LLM with domain-specific learning. By incorporating a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 2,000 MOF structures, over 7,000 related scientific papers, and a corpus exceeding 210 million tokens of specialized materials and chemical knowledge, we developed a domain-specific LLM for MOFs, referred to as MOFs-LLM. Through supervised fine-tuning, we unlocked the potential of MOFs-LLM in various tasks, including performance prediction, inverse design, mechanistic studies and application prospect analysis, with a specific focus on hydrogen storage material design challenges. In the practical application of reverse design, we utilize MOFs-LLM to mutate numerous ligands and select suitable building blocks, resulting in a structural space encompassing more than 100,000 MOFs. A MOF structure with highly promising hydrogen storage performance was ultimately successfully identified.

In this work, we report a methodology that uses a joint machine learning and experimental approach to obtain the optimal synthesis of a MOF. A synthetic conditions finder was used to derive the experimental protocols and a microwave based high-throughput robotic platform was used for the synthesis of Al-PMOF ([H2TCPP[AlOH]2(DMF3(H2O)2)]). Al-PMOF was previously synthesized using a hydrothermal reaction, which gave a low throughput yield due to its relatively long reaction time (16 hours). In this work, we carried out a systematic search for the optimal reaction conditions using a microwave assisted reaction synthesis. For this search we used a genetic algorithm and we show that already in the 2nd generation we obtained conditions that give excellent crystallinity and yield close to 80% in much shorter reaction time (50 minutes).

The mechanistic aspects of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed in this study. The extent of branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or just a single generation. The absence of further branching from the initial branches is the most distinguishing characteristic of a spherulite. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on initially fast-grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive over time, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and branching. These branching forms triangular branches fully connected to the rod surface, eventually growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the metal-organic sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single-crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure formed from achiral components consists of helical channels with opposite handedness. The chemical accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by the diffusion of a chromophore (sodium resorufin) into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized-light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.

Here, we extend this method, in combination with DFT-level geometry optimizations, to locate guest molecules inside the pores of metal-organic frameworks. The position and nature of the guest molecules tune the physicochemical properties of the host-guest systems. Therefore, it is essential to be able to reliably locate them to rationally enhance the performance of the known metal-organic frameworks and facilitate new material discovery. The results obtained with this approach are compared to experimental data. We show that the presented method can, in general, accurately locate adsorption sites and structures of the host-guest complexes. We therefore propose our approach as a computational alternative when no experimental structures of guest-loaded MOFs are available. Additional information on the adsorption strength in the studied host-guest systems emerges from the computed interaction energies.

Multireference diagnostics to estimate the magnitude of such static correlation have been primarily developed for molecular systems, with a range of computational costs from low to as costly as the full multi-reference calculation itself. We report the first application of low-cost multireference diagnostics on the solid state based on the fractional occupation number calculated with finite-temperature density functional theory (DFT). In order to compare the behavior of the diagnostics on solids and molecules, we select metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as model materials, since their reticular nature provides an intuitive way of identifying molecular derivatives. Two possible molecular fragmentations are considered: 1) breaking it down into its substituent secondary building unit and linker components and 2) extracting it in a finite cluster with a single metal atom. We demonstrate that the DFT-based multireference diagnostics are equally applicable to solids as to molecules. The magnitude and spatial distribution of the multireference character of a MOF are found to have a good correlation with those of the molecular derivatives, which can be calculated much more affordably in comparison to the full MOF. The additivity feature of the multireference character discussed here suggests molecular derivatives as a good representation of a MOF, facilitating accurate and efficient high throughput screening of MOFs and other porous solids.",0.8643775832694204,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:42:14.732173,False

With infinite structural possibilities, the MOF community is reliant on simulations to identify the most promising candidates for given applications. Among thousands of reported structures, many exhibit limited reproducibility - in either synthesis, performance, or both - owing to the sensitivity of synthetic conditions. Geometric distortions that may arise in the functional groups of pyrene-based ligands during synthesis and/or activation cannot easily be predicted. This sometimes leads to discrepancies between in-silico and experimental results. Here, we investigate a series of topologically similar pyrene MOFs for carbon capture, as in their orthorhombic crystal structure, the ligand stacks in a parallel fashion, creating a promising binding site for CO2. These structures share the same ligand 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy), but have different metals (M-TBAPy, with M = Al, Ga, In, Sc). As predicted, the metal is shown to affect the pyrene stacking distance, and therefore the CO2 uptake. Interestingly however, our study reveals that the choice of metal also affects the rotational freedom of the ligand's benzoate groups, impacting the overall predicted ranking of the MOFs based on their CO2 uptake. Crystallographic analysis reveals the presence of additional phases where the metal node allows for geometric rearrangement.

Recent studies show that its water uptake ability at low relative humidity (RH) can be improved by incorporating hydrophilic functional groups into the framework. In this work, we provide computational insights into the adsorption of water in UiO-66 and its functionalized derivatives to reveal the role played by different adsorption sites and functional groups in the adsorption mechanism. We started by developing molecular models for UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-OH, and UiO-66-(OH)2 compatible with the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential of water. We then benchmarked these models against ab initio data. We used these models to perform molecular dynamics simulations and calculate radial distribution functions, IR spectra, and two-dimensional density distribution maps for water in the MOFs. These results consistently show that the μ3-OH sites are the preferential interaction sites for water in UiO-66 and all its variants, and the formation of localised water clusters inside the octahedral pores is responsible for the abrupt step in the experimental adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, the presence of functional groups in the framework allows water to cluster in the octahedral pores at lower RH, thus making the MOF a more efficient water harvester.

					<p>Metal-organic frameworks offer a convenient means for capturing, transporting, and
releasing small molecules. Rational design of such systems requires an in-depth understanding of the
underlying non-covalent interactions, and the ability to easily and rapidly pre-screen candidate
architectures in silico. In this work, we devised a recipe for computing the strength and analysing the
nature of the host-guest interactions in MOFs. Using experimentally characterised complexes of
calcium-adipate framework with 4,4’-bipyridine and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane guests as test systems,
we have assessed a range of density functional theory methods, energy decomposition schemes, and
non-covalent interactions indicators across realistic periodic and finite supramolecular cluster scales.
We find that appropriately constructed clusters readily reproduce the key interactions occurring in
periodic models at a fraction of the computational cost and with an added benefit of diverse density
partitioning schemes. Host-guest interaction energies can be reliably computed with dispersion-
corrected density functional theory methods; however, decoding their precise nature demands insights
from energy decomposition schemes and quantum-chemical tools beyond local bonding indices (e.g.,
the quantum theory of atoms in molecules), such as the non-covalent interactions index and the
density overlap regions indicator.

However, its potential in predicting synthetic accessibility of materials remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of negative data. In this study, we employ several one-class classification (OCC) approaches to accelerate the development of novel metal-organic framework materials by predicting their synthesisability. The evaluation of OCC model performance poses challenges, as traditional evaluation metrics are not applicable when dealing with a single type of data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a quantitative approach, the Maximum Fractional Difference (MFD) method, to assess and compare model performance, as well as determine optimal thresholds for effectively distinguishing between positives and negatives. A DeepSVDD model with superior predictive capability is proposed. By combining assessment of synthetic viability with porosity prediction models, a list of 3,453 unreported combinations is generated characterised by predictions of high synthesisability and large pore size.

Mimicking human olfaction, an array of cross-sensitive, MOF-based sensors could enable analyte detection in complex, variable gas mixtures containing confounding gas species. Herein, we address the question: given a set of MOF candidates and their adsorption properties, how do we select the optimal subset to compose a sensor array that accurately and robustly predicts the gas composition via monitoring the adsorbed mass in each MOF? We first mathematically formulate the MOF-based sensor array problem under dilute conditions. Instructively, the sensor array can be viewed as a linear map from <i>gas composition space</i> to <i>sensor array response space</i> defined by the matrix <b>H</b> of Henry coefficients of the gases in the MOFs. Characterizing this mapping, the singular value decomposition of <b>H </b>is a useful tool for evaluating MOF subsets for sensor arrays, as it determines the sensitivity of the predicted gas composition to measurement error, quantifies the magnitude of the response to changes in composition, and recovers which direction in gas composition space elicits the largest/smallest response.

Enhancing the microstructure of the GDL directly improves transport properties, thereby leading to more efficient and durable PEMFCs. In this study, we developed a novel machine learning methodology to optimize the microstructure and properties of the GDL.  The developed optimization framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind and demonstrated high efficacy, with an R2 score ~95 % in 6 out of 7 properties and a R2 score ~90 % for the contact resistance, in identifying optimal manufacturing parameters to stochastically generate GDL microstructures and their associated properties. We validated our machine learning approach by comparing the predicted GDL properties to those calculated through digital characterization using physics-based methods from the stochastically reconstructed GDL, using the optimal manufacturing parameters identified by the optimizer. Our machine learning model was able to accurately predict 7 GDL properties with a significant decrease on the computational cost (~3 seconds wall time) compared to the physics-based calculations which takes ~3 - 4 hours wall time. In addition, the developed optimizer framework presented low fiber concentration accompanied by low compression ratio to achieve maximum diffusivity and minimum GDL-MPL contact resistance. Furthermore, prioritizing maximum electrical and/or thermal conductivities while minimizing GDL-MPL contact resistance require high fiber concentration with high compression ratio.

Although metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied as adsorbents for CO2¬ and CH4, less effort has focused on the use of MOFs to remove N2O from emission streams or from air. Further, N2O activation would enable its use as an inexpensive oxidant for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we identify features that contribute to strong binding and high uptake of N2O at coorinatively unsaturated metal sites in the M2Cl2(btdd) (M= Mn, Co, Ni, Cu; btdd2– = bis(1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4′,5′-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) and M2(dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; dobdc4− = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) series of MOFs. Combined experimental and computational studies suggest that N2O adsorption at open-metal-sites is primarily based on electrostatic interactions, rather than π-backbonding, causing MOFs with more Lewis acidic metal centers to be superior N2O adsorbents. As a result, Mg2(dobdc) demonstrates strong binding and record-setting N2O uptake (8.75 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K). Using density functional theory (DFT) to characterize reactive intermediates and transition states, we demonstrate that N2O activation to form a M(IV)-oxo species and N2 is thermodynamically favorable in Mn2(dobdc) and Fe2(dobdc) but appears to be kinetically limited in Mn2(dobdc).

Nanoporous materials (NPMs) could be utilized as recognition elements in a gas sensor because they selectively adsorb gas. Imitating mammalian olfaction, sensor arrays of NPMs use measurements of the adsorbed mass of gas in a set of distinct NPMs to infer the gas composition. Modular and adjustable NPMs, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), offer a vast materials space to sample for combinations to comprise a sensor array that produces a response pattern rich with information about the gas composition.<br /><br />Herein, we frame quantitative gas sensing, using arrays of NPMs, as an inverse problem, which equips us with a method to evaluate the fitness of a proposed combination of NPMs in a sensor array. While the (routine) forward problem is to use an adsorption model to predict the mass of gas adsorbed in the NPMs when immersed in a gas mixture of a given composition, the inverse problem is to predict the gas composition from the observed mass of adsorbed gas in each NPM. The fitness of a given combination of NPMs for gas sensing is then determined by the conditioning of its inverse problem: the prediction of the gas composition provided by a fit (unfit) combination of NPMs is insensitive (sensitive) to inevitable errors in the measurements of the mass of gas adsorbed in the NPMs. For illustration, we use experimentally measured adsorption data to analyze the conditioning of the inverse problem associated with a [IRMOF-1, HKUST-1] CH<sub>4</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> sensor array.",0.8567998164585909,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:42:53.445722,False

Here, we explore the adsorption properties that could be imparted to a MOF by a rotaxane molecular shuttle (RMS) in its pores. In the unit cell of an RMS-MOF, a macrocyclic wheel is mechanically interlocked with a strut of the MOF scaffold. The wheel shuttles between stations on the strut that are also gas adsorption sites. At a level of abstraction similar to the seminal Langmuir adsorption model, we pose and analyze a simple statistical mechanical model of gas adsorption in an RMS-MOF that accounts for (i) wheel/gas competition for sites on the strut and (ii) gas-induced changes in the configurational entropy of the shuttling wheel. We determine how the amount of gas adsorbed, position of the wheel, and differential energy of adsorption depend on temperature, pressure, and the interactions of the gas/wheel with the stations. Our model reveals that, compared to a rigid, Langmuir material, the chemistry of the RMS-MOF can be tuned to render gas adsorption more or less temperature-sensitive and to release more or less heat upon adsorption. The model also uncovers a non-monotonic relationship between the temperature and the position of the wheel if gas out-competes the wheel for its preferable station.",0.8551280771746945,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanostructured materials),2024-11-18 22:42:54.135120,False

Machine learning approaches to
materials stability prediction are typically assessed by their ability to reproduce results
from direct physical modeling, whereas ideally both machine learning and direct physical modeling should be assessed by their ability to reproduce reality. Additionally,
traditional evaluation metrics do not directly reflect the experience of an experimental
search for unknown compounds in a large candidate phase space, and often result in
overly optimistic assessments. Here, we (i) present a framework that combines density
functional theory and traditional supervised machine learning methods (ML/DFT),
and (ii) introduce the concepts of search completeness – the fraction of discoverable
compounds found relative to the fraction of search space explored – and search efficiency – the rate of discovery relative to the fraction of search space explored – to evaluate it. The ML/DFT framework is an iterative approach to predict stable
chemistries of a fixed crystal structure (here, spinels) that uses DFT to generate a
training set of unstable compounds. The training set of stable compounds is given by
experimentally known spinels. The method is carried out using random forest, LASSO,
and ridge regression to predict as-of-yet undiscovered spinel chemistries. TreeSHAP
analysis is used to determine features that most contribute to stability/instability classification. While no single feature dominates, several emerge that align with chemical
intuition. To estimate the efficacy of ML/DFT compared to pure DFT, we introduce
a Bayesian description of DFT distribution of energies for stable and unstable spinels.
The Bayesian model enables quantifying the search completeness and search efficiency
of DFT, which is then compared to that of ML/DFT. ML/DFT achieves search completeness and efficiency on par with pure DFT, despite requiring fewer DFT simulations
(∼300 vs. 14,200). More importantly, by quantitatively assessing ML approaches in
ways that better reflect how they would be used in materials discovery experiments,
we obtain key insights into the challenges that need to be overcome by such methods:
that the small number of stable compounds to be found in a search space orders of
magnitude larger places stringent demands on model accuracy to achieve good search
efficiency. Finally, we report the top candidates of our spinel search, which may be of

Small variations in MOF synthesis conditions can lead to a range of accessible frameworks with divergent chemical or photophysical properties. New meth-ods to controllably access phases with tailored properties would broaden the scope of MOFs that can be reliably prepared for specific applications.

In-depth spec-troscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies support that CORN-MOF-1 has a similar structure to M2(dobdc) but with partially protonated linkers and charge-balancing or coordinated formate groups in the pores. The resultant vari-ation in linker spacings causes CORN-MOF-1 (Mg) to be strongly photoluminescent in the solid state, whereas H4dobdc and Mg2(dobdc) are weakly emissive due to excimer formation. In addition, CORN-MOF-1 variants can be converted into high-quality samples of the thermodynamic M2(dobdc) phases by heating in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).

A crucial aspect of BO is how molecules and materials are represented as feature vectors, where both the completeness and compactness of these representations can influence the efficiency of the optimization process. Traditionally, a fixed representation is chosen by expert chemists or applying data-driven feature selection methods on available labelled datasets. However, when dealing with novel optimization tasks, prior knowledge or large datasets are often unavailable, and relying on these even can introduce bias into the search process. In this work, we demonstrate a Feature Adaptive Bayesian Optimization (FABO) framework, which integrates feature selection in the Bayesian optimization process to dynamically adapt material representations throughout the optimization cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive approach across several molecular optimization tasks, including the discovery of high-performing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three distinct tasks, each involving unique property distributions and requiring a distinct representation. Our results show that the adaptive nature of the representation leads to outperforming random search baseline and scenarios where prior knowledge of the feature space is available. Notably, for known optimization tasks, FABO automatically identifies representations that are aligned with human chemical intuition, validating its utility for optimization tasks where such insights are not available in advance. Lastly, we show how a biased representation can adversely impact BO performance, highlighting the importance of adaptive representation to different tasks. Our findings highlight FABO as a robust approach for navigating large, complex materials search spaces in automated discovery campaigns.",0.8598912954125214,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 22:45:36.344758,False

Compared to more accurate hybrid functionals, we find that the widely used PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional severely underpredicts MOF band gaps in a largely systematic manner for semi-conductors and insulators without magnetic character. However, an even larger and less predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations. With regards to partial atomic charges, we find that different density functional approximations predict similar charges overall, although hybrid functionals tend to shift electron density away from the metal centers and onto the ligand environments compared to the GGA point of reference. Much more significant differences in partial atomic charges are observed when comparing different charge partitioning schemes. We conclude by using the new dataset of computed MOF properties to train machine learning models that can rapidly predict MOF band gaps for all four density functional approximations considered in this work, paving the way for future high-throughput screening studies.

The electrochemical properties of such 2D frameworks are strongly related to their structure, which in turn is influenced by the synthesis conditions. However, even under formally identical conditions, MOF crystals with different structural properties are obtained, and to date there is no easy-to-apply method to predict the quality of MOF crystals already during synthesis. In the present work, we monitored the formation of phthalocyanine-based 2D MOFs at the air-water interface using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and identified Raman marker bands that characterise the degree of linker aggregation, the reaction progress, and the yield of MOFs formed during the reaction. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements on the MOF crystals after synthesis, a correlation between the Raman marker bands and the resulting crystalline domain size distribution of the MOF could be derived.

This study introduces a specialized set of charge and Lennard-Jones parameters tailored for electrostatically embedded QM/MM calculations, aiming to accurately model both adsorption processes and catalytic reactions in zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs). To validate our approach, we compare adsorption energies derived from QM/MM simulations against experimental results and Monte Carlo simulation outcomes. The developed parameters showcase the ability of QM/MM simulations to represent long-range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions faithfully. This capability is evidenced by the prediction of adsorption energies with a low root mean square error of 1.1 kcal/mol across a wide range of adsorbates. The practical applicability of our QM/MM model is further illustrated through the study of glucose isomerization and epimerization reactions catalyzed by two structurally distinct Zr-MOF catalysts, UiO-66 and MOF-808. Our QM/MM calculations closely align with experimental activation energies. Importantly, the parameter set introduced here is shown to be compatible with the widely used universal force field (UFF). Moreover, we thoroughly explore how the size of the cluster model and the choice of density functional theory (DFT) methodologies influence the simulation outcomes.

In this paper, we explore the nature of Hf metal clusters which form in different reaction solutions, including in a mixture of DMF, formic acid and water.

The efficiency of DFTB comes via pre-computed integrals, which are parameterized for each pair of atoms, and the requirement for this parameterization has previously prevented widespread use of DFTB for Metal-Organic Frameworks. The GFN-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent interactions Tight Binding) method provides parameters for elements up to Z≤86.

Application of MOFs in these scenarios is hindered, however, by difficulties in MOF ‘activation’ after initial synthesis – removal of the synthesis solvent from the pores to make the pore space accessible – leading to framework collapse if improperly performed. While experimental studies have correlated collapse to specific solvent properties and conditions, the mechanism of activation-collapse is currently unknown. Developing this understanding would enable researchers to create better activation protocols for MOFs, accelerating discovery and process intensification. To achieve this goal, we simulated solvent removal using grand-canonical Monte Carlo and free energy perturbation methods. By framing activation as a fluid desorption problem, we investigated activation processes in the IRMOF family of MOFs for different solvents. We identified two pathways for solvent activation – the solvent either desorbs uniformly from each individual pore or forms coexisting phases during desorption. These mesophases in turn lead to large capillary stresses within the framework, corroborating experimental hypotheses for the cause of activation-collapse. Finally, we found that the activation energy of solvent removal increased with pore size and connectivity due to the increased stability of solvent mesophases, matching experimental findings. Using these simulations, it is possible to screen MOF activation procedures, enabling rapid identification of ideal solvents and conditions and thus enabling faster development of MOFs for practical applications.",0.8581203950683438,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 22:46:34.036496,False

With such synergy in mind, this work presents the design of a novel MOF/polyazoamine support that is used to stabilize Pd NPs. The resulting composite catalyst, tested in the reductive amination of levulinic acid, is found to have a markedly improved lifetime when compared to just the MOF or polymer support containing Pd. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the lifetime enhancement stems directly from the polymer, which plays a dual role: i) the oligomer stabilizes the MOF support through the elimination of certain vibrational modes associated with the framework ligand and likely pore-filling effects in the largest MOF pore, and ii) the Lewis base functionality on the oligomer backbone binds to the surface of the Pd NPs, thus, increasing their activity and inhibiting their aggregation.

Here we report a density functional theory (DFT) based mul-ti-chemical model (cluster and periodic) transition-state study that reveals the likely active catalytic sites/species and the resulting reaction mechanism and selectivity for isobutylene dimerization catalyzed by sulfated MOF-808.

Of the two-dozen acidic sites we extensively examined, only one aqua group from the tri-sulfated MOF-808 Zr6 node exhibits strong enough acidity to produce a dimerization barrier consistent with the experiment. Reaction coordinate and transition state models indicate a novel concerted dimerization process that couples C–C bond formation, C–H bond cleav-age, and proton shuttling.

An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane-shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid-type metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks’ degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Usually, highly interpenetrated frameworks have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63% of the unit cell volume. The frameworks are chiral and formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry frameworks around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels with both chiralities are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated to the degree of interpenetration 10-, 16- and 32-fold.

Existing fast conformer prediction algorithms often rely on approximate empirical energy functions, resulting in low accuracy. More accurate methods like ab initio molecular dynamics and Markov chain Monte Carlo can be computationally expensive due to the need for evaluating quantum mechanical energy functions. To address this, we introduce AGDIFF, a novel machine learning framework that utilizes diffusion models for efficient and accurate molecular structure prediction. AGDIFF extends previous models (such as GeoDiff) by enhancing the global, local, and edge encoders with attention mechanisms, an improved SchNet architecture, batch normalization, and feature expansion techniques. AGDIFF outperforms GeoDiff on both the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. For GEOM-QM9, with a threshold (δ) of 0.5 Å, AGDIFF achieves a mean COV-R of 93.08% and a mean MAT-R of 0.1965 Å.

			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Force-field development has undergone a revolution in the past decade with the
proliferation of quantum chemistry based parameterizations and the introduction of
machine learning approximations of the atomistic potential energy surface. Nevertheless, transferable force-fields with broad coverage of organic chemical space remain
necessary for applications in materials and chemical discovery where throughput, consistency, and computational cost are paramount. Here we introduce a force-field development framework called Topology Automated Force-Field Interactions (TAFFI) for
developing transferable force-fields of varying complexity against an extensible database of quantum chemistry calculations. TAFFI formalizes the concept of atom typing and
makes it the basis for generating systematic training data that maintains a one-to-one
correspondence with force-field terms. This feature makes TAFFI arbitrarily extensible to new chemistries while maintaining internal consistency and transferability. As
a demonstration of TAFFI, we have developed a fixed-charge force-field, TAFFI-gen,
from scratch that includes coverage for common organic functional groups that is comparable to established transferable force-fields. The performance of TAFFI-gen was
benchmarked against OPLS and GAFF for reproducing several experimental proper-
ties of 87 organic liquids. The consistent performance of these force-fields, despite their
distinct origins, validates the TAFFI framework while also providing evidence of the
representability limitations of fixed-charge force-fields.</p>

quantum dissipative dynamics","Machine learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to study the quantum dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems. To facilitate the use of our recently published ML-based approaches for quantum dissipative dynamics, here we present an open-source Python package MLQD (https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/MLQD), which currently supports the three ML-based quantum dynamics approaches: (1) the recursive dynamics with kernel ridge regression (KRR) method, (2) the non-recursive artificial-intelligence-based quantum dynamics (AIQD) approach and (3) the blazingly fast one-shot trajectory learning (OSTL) approach, where both AIQD and OSTL use the convolutional neural networks (CNN). This paper describes the features of the MLQD package, the technical details, optimization of hyperparameters, visualization of results, and the demonstration of the MLQD's applicability for two widely studied systems, namely the spin-boson model and the Fenna--Matthews--Olson (FMO) complex. To make MLQD more user-friendly and accessible, we have made it available on the Python Package Index (PyPi) platform and it can be installed via pip install mlqd.

autoencoding algorithms for measured optical properties of metal oxides, which can serve as an exemplar for the breadth and depth of data

quaternary oxide compositions, making it the largest and most diverse experimental materials set utilized in machine learning studies. The
extensive dataset enabled training and validation of 3 distinct models for mapping between sample images and absorption spectra, including a
conditional variational autoencoder that generates images of hypothetical materials with tailored absorption properties. The absorption patterns
auto-generated from sample images capture the salient features of ground truth spectra, and direct band gap energies extracted from these
auto-generated patterns are quite accurate with a mean absolute error of 240 meV, which is the approximate uncertainty from traditional

While high-level solid-state density functional theory (DFT) methods allow for mostly reliable discrimination of the low energy structures, their high computational cost is problematic because of the need to evaluate tens to hundreds of thousands of trial crystal structures to fully explore typical crystal energy landscapes. Consequently, lower-cost but less accurate empirical force fields are often used, sometimes as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme involving multiple stages of increasingly accurate energy calculations. Machine learned potentials (MLPs), trained to reproduce the results of ab initio methods with computational cost close to that of force fields, can improve the efficiency of CSP by reducing or eliminating the need for costly DFT calculations at the final stages of CSP. Here, we investigate active learning methods for training MLPs with CSP datasets. The combination of active learning with the well-developed sampling methods from CSP yields potentials in a highly automated workflow that are relevant over a wide range of the crystal packing space. To demonstrate these potentials, we illustrate efficiently re-ranking large, diverse crystal structure landscapes to near-DFT accuracy from force field-based CSP, improving the reliability of the final energy ranking. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these potentials can be extended to more accurately model structures far from lattice energy minima through additional on-the-fly training within Monte Carlo simulations.",0.8595250495076588,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 22:49:50.241901,False

These calculations can frequently lead to a null result, e.g., the calculation does not converge or the molecule does not stay intact during a geometry optimization. To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of  deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on non- productive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data. This dynamic model generalizes more readily than the static classifier by becoming more predictive as input simulation length increases.

Stable metal-oxo species have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating the development of structure-property relationships. To overcome these challenges, we train the first machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting metal-oxo formation energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states. Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel ridge regression or artificial neural network ML models, we achieve good mean absolute errors (4-5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations. Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance of non-local, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing both expected trends in oxo formation energetics, such as destabilization of the metal-oxo species with increasing <i>d</i>-filling, as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity.

We compared this approach with dedicated machine-learning models for many applications spanning properties of molecules and materials to the yield of chemical reactions.

In contrast, most contemporary machine learning (ML) in the chemical sciences is inductive learning from example, with a fixed set of features. Chemical workflows are replete with situations requiring deduction, including many aspects of lab automation and spectral interpretation. Here, a general strategy is described for designing and training machine learning models capable of deduction that consists of combining individual inductive models into a larger deductive network. The training and testing of these models is demonstrated on the task of deducing reaction products from a mixture of spectral sources. The resulting models are capable of distinguishing between intended and unintended reaction outcomes and identifying starting material based on a mixture of spectral sources. The models are also capable of performing well on tasks that they were not directly trained on, like predicting minor products from named organic chemistry reactions, identifying reagents and isomers as plausible impurities, and handling missing or conflicting information. A new dataset of 1,124,043 simulated spectra that were generated to train these models is also distributed with this work.

Although deep-learning-based molecule generators have shown promise, it is unclear to what extent they can be useful in real-world materials development. To assess the reliability of AI-assisted chemistry, we prepared a platform using the ChemTS molecule generator and a DFT simulator, and attempted to generate novel photo-functional molecules whose lowest excited states lie at desired energetic levels. A ten-day run on 12 cores discovered 86potential photo-functional molecules around target lowest excitation levels, designated as 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 nm. Among the molecules discovered, six were synthesized and five were confirmed to reproduce DFT predictions in ultraviolet visible absorption measurements.

For discovery workflows to be predictive, we need automated, low-cost methods that can distinguish the regions of chemical space where DFT should be applied from those where it should not. We curate over 4,800 open-shell transition-metal complexes up to hundreds of atoms in size from prior high-throughput DFT studies and evaluate affordable, finite-temperature DFT evaluation of fractional occupation number (FON)-based MR diagnostics. We show that intuitive measures of strong correlation (i.e., the HOMO–LUMO gap) are not predictive of MR character as judged by FON-based diagnostics. Analysis of independently trained machine learning (ML) models to predict HOMO–LUMO gaps and FON-based diagnostics reveals differences in metal- and ligand-sensitivity of the two quantities.

3DED data, particularly when the crystal symmetry is low. This drawback can be
overcome by high throughput data collection using continuous rotation electron

example. ZIF-EC1 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with a plate-like
morphology. cRED data of ZIF-EC1 with different completeness and resolution

a completeness as low as 44.5% and refined to a high precession (better than

A simple solvothermal procedure was developed for the synthesis of UiO-66 and UiO-67 using the air/moisture stable zirconyl chloride octahydrate as a starting reagent.

In this work, we studied the possibility of using machine learning-trained algorithms in order to calculate the thermal properties of siliceous zeolite frameworks. We used as training data the thermal properties of 120 zeolites, calculated at the DFT level, in the quasi-harmonic approximation. We compared the statistical accuracy of trained models (based on the gradient boosting regression technique) using different types of descriptors, including ad hoc geometrical features, topology, pore space, and general geometric descriptors. While geometric descriptors were found to perform best, we also identified limitations on the accuracy of the predictions, especially for a small group of materials with very highly negative thermal expansion coefficients. We then studied the generalizability of the technique, demonstrating that the predictions were not sensitive to the refinement of framework structures at a high level of theory. Therefore, the models are suitable for the exploration and screening of large-scale databases of hypothetical frameworks, which we illustrate on the PCOD2 database of zeolites containing around 600,000 hypothetical structures.",0.8589727524976148,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 22:58:27.848493,False

As an example of a fundamental design challenge with industrial relevance, we search for novel stable radical scaffolds for an aqueous redox flow battery that simultaneously satisfy redox requirements at the anode and cathode. To meet this challenge, we develop a new open-source molecular optimization framework based on AlphaZero coupled with a fast, machine learning-derived surrogate objective trained with nearly 100,000 quantum chemistry simulations. The objective function comprises two graph neural networks: one that predicts adiabatic oxidation and reduction potentials and a second that predicts electron density and local 3D environment, previously shown to be correlated with radical persistence and stability. With no hand-coded knowledge of organic chemistry, the reinforcement learning agent finds molecule candidates that satisfy a precise combination of redox, stability, and synthesizability requirements defined at the quantum chemistry level, many of which have reasonable predicted retrosynthetic pathways.

pre-clinical early drug discovery, novel compounds are often designed based on an already existing promising
starting compound through structural modifications for further property optimization. Recently,
transformer-based deep learning models have been explored for the task of molecular optimization by training
on pairs of similar molecules. This provides a starting point for generating similar molecules to a given input
molecule, but has limited flexibility regarding user-defined property profiles. Here, we evaluate the effect of
reinforcement learning on transformer-based molecular generative models. The generative model can be
considered as a pre-trained model with knowledge of the chemical space close to an input compound, while
reinforcement learning can be viewed as a tuning phase, steering the model towards chemical space with
user-specific desirable properties. The evaluation of two distinct tasks - molecular optimization and scaffold
discovery - suggest that reinforcement learning could guide the transformer-based generative model towards
the generation of more compounds of interest. Additionally, the impact of pre-trained models, learning steps

For training data, we built a new dataset, ProteinReactiveDB, composed primarily of covalent and noncovalent inhibitors from  the DrugBank, BindingDB, and CovalentInDB databases. To assess the transferability of the trained models, we created a custom set of covalent and noncovalent inhibitors, which was constructed from the recent literature. Baseline models were developed using Morgan fingerprints as training inputs, but they performed poorly when applied to compounds outside the training set.

However, assessing the bioactivities of PFASs is both time-consuming and costly due to the sheer number and expense of in vivo and in vitro biological experiments. To this end, we harnessed new unsupervised/semi-supervised machine learning models to automatically predict bioactivities of PFAS in various human biological targets, including enzymes, genes, proteins, and cell lines.

PF with rationally chosen substituents based on known electronic and steric properties is a commonly used experimental and computational strategy in screening, design and optimization of catalytic scaffolds. Automated generation of reasonably accurate geometric representations of post-functionalized molecular scaffolds is highly desirable for data-driven applications. However, automated PF of transition metal (TM) complexes remains challenging. In this work a Python-based workflow, ChemSpaX, that is aimed at automating the PF of a given molecular scaffold with special emphasis on TMcomplexes, is introduced. In three representative applications of ChemSpaX by comparing with DFT and DFT-B calculations, we show that the generated structures have a reasonable quality for use in computational screening applications.

Methods capable of predicting melting points (MP) solely from chemical structure represent a canonical example, and are highly desirable in many crucial industrial applications. In this work, we explore a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and understand the MP of molecules. Several experimental databases are aggregated from the literature to design a low-bias dataset that includes 3D structural and quantum-chemical properties. Using experimental and polymorph-induced uncertainties, we derive a tenable lower limit for MP prediction accuracy, and apply graph neural networks and Gaussian processes to predict MP competitive with these error bounds. To further understand how MP correlates with molecular structure, we employ several semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. First, we use unsupervised clustering methods to identify classes of molecules, their common fragments, and expected errors for each data set. We then build molecular geometric spaces shaped by MP with a semi-supervised variational autoencoder and graph embedding spaces, and apply graph attribution methods to highlight atom-level contributions to MP within the datasets. Overall, this work serves as a case study of how to employ a diversified ML toolkit to predict and understand correlations between molecular structures and thermophysical properties of interest.</p>",0.8520993447575286,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 23:09:25.242301,False

We named the representations as the <i>reason vectors</i>. In contrast to the high-dimensional chemical fingerprints, reason vectors are much simpler with only about 5 dimensions. They allow abstract reasoning for bioactivity of chemicals or absence thereof, uncover causal factors in interactions between chemical features and generalize beyond specific chemical classes or bioactivity. These qualities enable us to perform powerful similarity searches that are vague and conceptual in nature. The methodology can handle novel combinations of features in query molecules and can evaluate chemical classes that are entirely absent in training data. The method consists of similarity-based near neighbor search on a reference database of biologically tested chemicals by a series of substructures obtained from stepwise reconstruction of the test molecule. A data-driven continuous representation of molecular fragments was used for molecular similarity computations. The technique was inspired by the ability of humans to learn and generalize complex concepts by interacting with the physical world. We also show that activity prediction of chemicals using the abstract reason vectors is very easy and straightforward, as compared to modeling in the raw chemistry space, and can be applied to both binary and continuous activity outcomes. Except for utilizing an unsupervised training to construct continuous molecular fingerprints, the methodology is devoid of gradient optimization or statistical fitting.</p>",0.851095415184826,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 23:10:42.649687,False

For example, glycerol can undergo a hydro-deoxygenation reaction to produce propanediol, a valuable chemical precursor. This reaction captures the complexity and challenges of modelling surface-reactivity of flexible organic molecules in heterogenous catalysis, where surface intermediates can have many configurations. High computational costs of Density Functional Theory(DFT) restrict exhaustive exploration of the factorial reaction space, leading to having limited insights of the hydrodeoxygenation mechanism and hindering rational catalyst design. We deploy a Machine-Learned-Force-Field (MLFF) driven approach to elucidate the complex reaction network involved in the hydro-deoxygenation of glycerol on Cu(111). We present the bond cleavage activity ranking order for glycerol, and other intermediates and identify reaction pathways resulting in 1,2-PDO formation while highlighting indications of its higher selectivity over 1,3-PDO. This investigation delivers a comprehensive exploration of the transformation process from glycerol to propanediol, addressing the existing knowledge deficit through an advanced active-learning based MLFF approach.

Similarly, to the Word2vec models where vectors of closely related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns vector representations of molecular substructures that are pointing in similar directions for chemically related substructures. Compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing up vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, feed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pre-trained once, yields dense vector representations and overcomes drawbacks of common compound feature representations such as sparseness and bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results obtained for Morgan fingerprints as reference compound representation. Mol2vec can be easily combined with ProtVec, which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment independent and can be thus also easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.",0.8532708369070137,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 23:11:22.054257,False

We apply this method to a curated dataset of Heme-Iron Oxidoreductases, spanning three enzyme classes: monooxygenases, peroxidases, and catalases. Conventional analysis, focused on simplistic, point electric fields along the Fe-O bond, are shown to be inadequate for accurate activity prediction. Our model demonstrates that the enzyme's heterogenous 3-D electric field, alone, can accurately predict its function, without relying on additional protein-specific information. Through feature selection, we uncover key electric field components that not only validate previous studies but also underscore the crucial role of multiple components beyond the traditionally emphasized electric field along the Fe-O bond in heme enzymes. Further, by integrating protein dynamics, principal component analysis, clustering, and QM/MM calculations, we reveal that while dynamic complexities in protein structures can complicate predictions, accounting for this increased dynamic variability can substantially enhance model performance. This research significantly advances our understanding of how protein scaffolds possess signature electric fields that are tailored to their functions at the active site.

The goal of this challenge is to have a realistic split of chemical structures (compounds) between training, validation and test set such that the performance on the test set is meaningful to infer the performance in a prospective application. This challenge is by its own very interesting and relevant,but is even more complex in a federated machine learning approach where multiple partners jointly train a model under privacy-preserving conditions where chemical structures must not be shared between the different participating parties in the federated learning. In this work we discuss three methods which provide a splitting of the data set and are applicable in a federated privacy-preserving setting, namely: a. locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), b. sphere exclusion clustering, c. scaffold-based binning (scaffold network). For evaluation of these splitting methods we consider the following quality criteria: bias in prediction performance, label and data imbalance, distance of the test set compounds to the training set and compare them to a random splitting. The main findings of the paper are a. both sphere exclusion clustering and scaffold-based binning result in high quality splitting of the data sets, b. in terms of compute costs sphere exclusion clustering is very expensive in the case of federated privacy-preserving setting.",0.8507806261009832,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-18 23:14:26.148164,False

However, condensed matter effects can result in complex non-linear deformations. Moreover, this highly relevant in reactions that include both thermal and mechanical influences on the reaction rate. Here we define a formalism that describes kinetic effect of molecular shape distortions as a sum over the normal modes and how those modes project onto the reactions path. By coupling this framework with a 'cost' function that defines the thermal and mechanical energy balance for a specific reaction condition, a general efficiency of the mechanochemistry is derived. We apply this concept to reactions in energetic materials where a shockwave of some energy can impart a distribution of both kinetic energy and molecular strains on the system. We derive under what conditions that mechanical energy is preferential or detrimental to local reaction rates. This workflow is general, with a proper cost function, can be applied to a wide variety of fundamental and industrial mechanochemical applications, where the cost function can define a wide range of energetic, environmental, and financial results based on changes to the reaction conditions.

Using MOs of rigid molecules as references, the MOs that can be directly regarded to be quasi-diabatic in molecular dynamics are selected out, state tracked, and phase corrected. On the basis of this information, artificial neural networks are trained to characterize the structure-dependent onsite energies of quasi-diabatic MOs and the inter-molecular electronic couplings.

However, the construction of a general force field remains challenging due to the vast conformational and chemical space. Training data sets typically cover only a limited region of this space, resulting in poor extrapolation performance. Traditional strategies inadequately address this problem by training models from scratch using both old and new datasets. In addition, model transferability is crucial for general force field construction. Existing ML force fields, designed for closed systems with no external environmental potential, exhibit limited transferability to complex condensed phase systems such as enzymatic reactions, resulting in inferior performance and high memory costs. Our ML/MM model based on the Taylor expansion of the electrostatic operator showed high transferability between reactions in several simple solvents. In this work, we extend the strategy to enzymatic reactions to explore transferability between more complex heterogeneous environments.

In recent years, several in silico models for SoM prediction have become available, many of which include a machine-learning component. The bottleneck in the further development of these approaches is the coverage of distinct atom environments and rare and complex biotransformation events with high-quality experimental data. In this context, active learning strategies could yield higher data efficiency and, in addition, provide guidance to experimentalists on which atom environments to investigate next for maximum information gain.  Here we report on the development and validation of FAME.AL, an active learning approach for site-of-metabolism prediction that builds on the previously published FAst MEtabolizer (FAME 3). The active learning approach yielded competitive performance for phase 1 and phase 2 metabolism (Matthews correlation coefficients of approximately 0.50 on holdout data) while using only 20% of the training data used by classical modeling setups. Besides high performance and high data efficiency, the active learning approach is also characterized by high robustness and speed. The approach is largely invariant to starting conditions and parameters, and substantial speed-ups can be yielded by using small atom batches rather than individual atoms during the iterative model-building process. The source code of FAME.AL is publicly available.

Limited but major effort has been already put forward in choosing appropriate machine learning (ML) methods among the popular ones like least squares (LS), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and a few more. The RF and Bayesian neural network (BNN) algorithms have been reported to be promising when combined with advanced descriptors representing ligand properties and protein-ligand interactions. However, the selection of descriptors that would correlate well with the unbinding kinetic properties is still a challenge. In this work, we derived a baseline RF model using descriptors representing the protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs) along the ligand unbinding pathway otherwise can be called dynamic IFPs. We found that the dynamic IFPs in addition to the static or binding pocket IFPs significantly improved the quality of our model for the prediction of ligand dissociation rate constant (koff). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt towards using the dynamic IFPs in deriving a quantitative structure-kinetics relationship (QSKR) model for the prediction of koff.",0.8512082096072038,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-19 00:11:48.558285,False

Utilizing a modified Transformer model with attention mechanisms, the MMT simultaneously processes multiple data modalities to focus on the most relevant spectral features. Our approach demonstrates significant advancements in automated structure determination, achieving up to 94% correct identifications for real experimental samples despite being trained solely on simulated spectra. To address the challenges of vast chemical space and limited experimental data we introduce an innovative improvement cycle that allows MMT to adapt to new chemical spaces. The model's robustness is evidenced by its ability to maintain substantial predictive power even when starting with slightly incorrect molecular structures, identifying 56% of experimental molecules correctly from modified initial guesses. MMT provides explainable predictions through token-based analysis, offering insights into its decision-making process. We also present a user-friendly GUI that integrates the full improvement cycle workflow, facilitating practical application in chemistry laboratories. By leveraging diverse spectral inputs and adaptive learning techniques, MMT represents a significant step towards fully automated structure elucidation, potentially accelerating drug discovery and natural product research while demonstrating that comprehensive chemical space coverage in training data is more critical than precise spectral accuracy.",0.8511908958738308,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-19 00:18:10.855866,False

As an integral tensor decomposition technique,  the density-fitting (DF) approach becomes a popular tool to reduce the memory and disk requirements for the electron repulsion integrals. In this study, an application programming interface (API) framework, denoted Molint (MFW),  for the computation of molecular integrals and their first derivatives, over contracted Gaussian functions, for the density-fitted methods is reported. The MFW is free software and it includes overlap, dipole, kinetic, potential, metric, and 3-index integrals, and their first derivatives. Furthermore, the MFW provides a smooth approach to build the Fock matrix and evaluate analytic gradients for the density-fitted methods. The MFW is a C++/Fortran hybrid code, which can take advantage of shared-memory parallel programming techniques. Our results demonstrate that the MFW is an efficient and user-friendly API for the computation of molecular integrals and their first derivatives.",0.8525613690641299,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR ((COF-based materials OR COF synthesis) OR (ZIF-based materials OR ZIF synthesis)),2024-11-19 00:35:51.120805,False
