However, the potential of AI to work backwards, towards predicting/designing a finetuned material for a given separation, remains untapped. Recent works report the inverse design of functionalized materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but they are limited to targeted sorption properties, while diffusivity, D, which is the driving force in membrane-based separations, is omitted. Herein, we report a tool combining a biologically inspired evolutionary algorithm with machine learning to design fine-tuned Zeolitic-Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-family of MOFs, for desired sets of diffusivities (Di, Di/Dj) values of any given mixture of species i and j. We moreover display the efficacy of our tool, by designing ZIFs that meet industrial performance criteria of permeability and selectivity, for CO2/CH4, O2/N2 and C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. We validate the designed ZIFs through appropriate simulations, confirming the suitability of the AI-suggested ZIF designs.",0.9217089663461129,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:37:39.026722,False

The overwhelming majority of the studies is focused on propylene/propane separation. Nevertheless, as the ultimate goal is to obtain propylene as the end product, propylene-selective MOFs necessitate a demanding and complex desorption process, which consumes a substantial amount of energy and involves intricate operations. Consequently, having an adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs propane instead would be more advantageous. This approach would enable the production of high-purity propylene in a single step and lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and the quantity of adsorbent required. The Computation-Ready Experimental Metal-Organic Framework (CoRE MOF) 2019 database is utilized for the computational screening of flexible MOFs using molecular dynamics simulations to identify materials with strong potential for separating propane/propylene via self-diffusion. This screening process is the first to fully consider the impact of framework flexibility on the discovery of guest self-diffusion coefficients. The study underscores the significance of accounting for framework flexibility in investigations of gas molecules transport in MOFs, showcases the potential of using data-driven approaches to identify high-performance materials, and suggests methods for enhancing the predictive capabilities of screening workflows.  The top 5 MOFs from the CoRE MOF database for propane and propylene separation at a temperature of 298 K are identified. It is observed that the presence of carbonyl groups greatly enhances the separation properties between propane and propylene. Subsequently, a machine learning approach is utilized to develop a model and uncover important features. The machine learning model's predicted values for self-diffusion are reasonably consistent with the data obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.",0.9211810858372056,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:37:39.558978,False

Potential for Metal-Organic Frameworks","Machine-learned Potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling `quantum-accurate' potentials to linear time complexity. Yet, while they provide a more accurate reproduction of structural properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training dataset from \textit{ab initio} calculations. However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3,000 Zn-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations. More broadly, our contribution facilitates the development of general MLPs to accelerate chemical discoveries among other systems of interest at a fraction of the computational cost.

Building upon and extending the comparative analysis, our investigation underscores the CATBoost model's remarkable predictive prowess, characterized by a significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) and an enhanced R-squared (R²) value, thereby affirming its superior accuracy and reliability in forecasting CO2 adsorption. A pivotal aspect of our research is the integration of SHAP values for a detailed assessment of feature importance, which not only corroborated 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area' as pivotal determinants of CO2 uptake but also illuminated the model's advanced analytical capabilities in handling categorical features and mitigating overfitting, even within a dataset marked by intricate and non-linear patterns. Our quantitative and conceptual analysis, showcasing up to a 15% improvement in (RMSE) over previous models, reveals the CATBoost model’s unparalleled efficiency in discerning the multifaceted interplay of factors influencing CO2 adsorption. This is crucial for the strategic engineering of MOFs with optimized properties. Beyond 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area', our SHAP analysis highlighted other descriptors with substantial values, elucidating their nuanced contributions to CO2 uptake and providing invaluable insights for the MOF design process.

Owing to their high surface area, porosity, and tunability, MOFs have received significant attention for numerous applications such as gas separation and storage. Atomistic simulations and data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) have been successfully employed to screen large databases and successfully develop new experimentally synthesized and validated MOFs for CO2 capture. To enable data-driven materials discovery for any application, the first (and arguably most crucial) step is database curation. This work introduces the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC-MOF) database. This is a database of ~280,000 MOFs which have been either experimentally characterized or computationally generated, spanning all publicly available MOF databases. A key feature of ARC-MOF is that it contains DFT-derived electrostatic potential fitted partial atomic charges for each MOF. Additionally, ARC-MOF contains pre-computed descriptors for out-of-the-box machine learning applications. An in-depth analysis of the diversity of ARC-MOF with respect to the currently mapped design space of MOFs was performed – a critical, yet commonly overlooked aspect of previously reported MOF databases. Using this analysis, balanced subsets from ARC-MOF for various machine learning purposes have been identified.

The intrinsic length and time scales often stretch far beyond the nanometer and picosecond range due to e.g. large spatial heterogeneities or complex phase transitions. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can extend the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) towards such challenging systems,  but the generation of a representative training set of atomic configurations still poses a major challenge. In this work, we present an incremental learning scheme that constructs accurate and transferable MLPs based on a minimal number of DFT evaluations. Key to the approach is a combination of an active learning scheme that generates systematically improved MLPs with efficient and parallelized enhanced sampling protocols that explore increasingly larger portions of the phase space and learn physical interactions on-the-fly. The method requires a single atomic structure and a collective variable as input, after which the incremental learning approach constructs accurate interatomic potentials based on as few as 1000 single point DFT evaluations, even for flexible frameworks with multiple structurally different phases. The accuracy of the obtained potentials is extensively validated in terms of structural and mechanical properties across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, yielding thermodynamically transferable MLPs. Finally, it is demonstrated how the incremental learning approach shows great potential to train universal MLPs for a larger set of materials. A proof of principle based on 10 well-known aluminum- and zirconium-based MOFs is shown. The proposed incremental learning approach is universally applicable and may induce a paradigm shift in both the accuracy as well as the time and length scale of computational models for framework materials.",0.922706017516084,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:37:43.527431,False

In this study, we present a novel approach to further enhance the properties of porous polymer membranes emerging from MOFs through crosslinking of the organic linker molecules and subsequent metal-atom removal. To ensure reproducibility of the multi-step synthesis process and high quality of the resulting polymeric membranes, we automated the process and followed a machine learning optimization approach. The high-quality MOF-thin films (SURMOFs) were prepared in a layer-by-layer fashion directly on gold-coated porous alumina substrates. This direct synthesis proved crucial to preserve the structural integrity of the membranes and thus avoiding defect formation caused by a substrate-transfer process, which is usually required when advanced materials are used to fabricate a membrane. The initial SURMOF membrane exhibits moderate gas separation performance, once crosslinked, its gas selectivity could be significantly enhanced although with the compromise of lower gas permeance. Interestingly, once we removed the metal centers and thereby converted the SURMOF into a purely organic polymeric membrane, the membrane gas permeance could be restored almost to its initial condition while preserving the enhanced selectivities. In particular, the resulting polymeric membrane outperforms most commercially available polymer membranes for H2 /CO2 gas separation.

The presence of open metal sites (OMS) significantly influences the catalytic, adsorption, and separation capabilities of MOFs. However, common laboratory methods are indirect and can suffer from structural heterogeneity. Computational methods, including machine learning, play a central role in the rational design of MOFs, yet in silico detection of OMS still relies heavily on computationally expensive simulations. In this work, we use extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) and random forest (RF) methods to predict the existence of OMS in various MOF compounds based on structural and chemical features. RF provided a higher prediction accuracy of 0.891 compared to 0.865 of XGBoost. Average ionization energy, average electron affinity, and fraction of electrons in d orbitals exhibited the highest importance scores across the two models. These prediction models not only provide novel insights into the structural-property relationship between MOFs and OMS, but also would enable accurate and efficient exploration of MOFs that would give rise to OMS, facilitating the engineering of sorption, separation, and catalytic properties.

MFMs have a wide variety of potential and realised adsorption applications. In order to design an ideal framework material for a particular application, the composition of molecular fragments is not the only factor, but the arrangement of the those fragments is also important, especially when the fragments (molecular building blocks) are chemically functionalised and lack symmetry. As has been observed in Metal Organic Frameworks, the flexibility and absorption properties may differ greatly when altering the orientation of the building units or changing the position of functional groups. However, although the position of functional group has a great influence on a targeted property, studies on functional group arrangements have only been performed on a small set of MOF structures.

In this contribution, we develop a fingerprint/descriptor for optimising functionalised molecular framework structures using machine learning. We begin from  the  perspective of a molecular framework structure described as a collection of discrete pore shapes. To describe the chemical environment of the pore, we derive a fingerprint based on the occurrence of pairwise distances between functional groups in each pore. We present the possibilities of functional group arrangements in the 14 most common pore shapes, created by ditopic (2-connected) linkers are presented.

For example, in a carbon capture process, the heat required to regenerate a solid sorbent is directly related to the heat capacity of the material. However, for most materials suitable for carbon capture applications the heat capacity is not known, and thus the standard procedure is to assume the same value for all materials. In this work, we developed a machine-learning approach to accurately predict the heat capacity of these materials, i.e., zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent-organic frameworks. The accuracy of our prediction is confirmed with novel experimental data.

In this case, the role of membrane-based separation cannot be neglected since, compared with other conventional process, membrane-based process is more effective and consumes less energy. Regarding this, metal-based membranes, particularly palladium, are usually employed for hydrogen separation because of its high selectivity. However, with the advancement of various microporous materials, they could challenge the status quo of the metal-based membranes since they could offer both high hydrogen permeability and selectivity while also relatively cheaper to be produced. In this article, the advancement of five main microporous material membranes, namely silica-based membranes, zeolite membranes, carbon-based membranes, metal organic frameworks/covalent organic frameworks (MOF/COF) membranes and microporous polymeric membranes are extensively discussed. Their performances for hydrogen separation are then summarized to give further insights regarding the pathway that should be taken to direct the research direction in the future.

solids with tunable structures that make it possible to impart specific
chemical functionality tailored for a given application. However, the enormous
number of possible MOFs that can be synthesized makes it difficult to determine
which materials would be the most promising candidates, especially for
applications governed by electronic structure properties that are often
computationally demanding to simulate and time-consuming to probe
experimentally. Here, we have developed the first publicly available quantum-chemical
database for MOFs (the “QMOF database”), which consists of properties derived
from density functional theory (DFT) for over 14,000 experimentally synthesized
MOFs. Throughout this study, we demonstrate how this new database can be used
to identify MOFs with targeted electronic structure properties. As a
proof-of-concept, we use the QMOF database to evaluate the performance of
several machine learning models for the prediction of DFT-computed band gaps
and find that crystal graph convolutional neural networks are capable of
achieving superior predictive performance, making it possible to circumvent
computationally expensive quantum-chemical calculations. We also show how
unsupervised learning methods can aid the discovery of otherwise subtle structure–property
relationships using the computational findings in this work. We conclude by
highlighting several MOFs with low band gaps, a challenging task given the
electronically insulating nature of most MOF structures. The data and
predictive models generated in this work, as well as the database of MOF

In this work, we introduce a transfer learning technique to improve the accuracy and applicability of ML models trained with small amount of MOF adsorption data. This technique leverages potentially shareable knowledge from a source task to improve the models on the target tasks. As demonstrations, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data with 13,506 MOF structures at 100 bar and 243 K is used as the source task. When transferring knowledge from the source task to H<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 100 bar and 130 K (one target task), the predictive accuracy on target task was improved from 0.960 (direct training) to 0.991 (transfer learning).

Based on further analysis, transfer learning will always work on the target tasks with low generalizability. However, when transferring the knowledge from the source task to Xe/Kr adsorption, the transfer learning does not improve the predictive accuracy, which is attributed to the lack of common descriptors that is key to the underlying knowledge.  <b></b></p>",0.9161584950941145,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:37:53.317973,False

In molecular simulations of gas adsorption/diffusion in MOFs, the adsorbate-MOF electrostatic interaction is typically modeled by placing partial point charges on the atoms of the MOF. For the virtual screening of large libraries of MOFs, it is critical to develop computationally inexpensive methods to assign atomic partial charges to MOFs that accurately reproduce the electrostatic potential in their pores. Herein, we design and train a message passing neural network (MPNN) to predict the atomic partial charges on MOFs under a charge neutral constraint. A set of ca. 2,250 MOFs labeled with high-fidelity partial charges, derived from periodic electronic structure calculations, serves as training examples. In an end-to-end manner, from charge-labeled crystal graphs representing MOFs, our MPNN machine-learns features of the local bonding environments of the atoms and learns to predict partial atomic charges from these features. Our trained MPNN assigns high-fidelity partial point charges to MOFs with orders of magnitude lower computational cost than electronic structure calculations.

As there are millions of possible MOFs (with tens of thousands already synthesized), molecular simulation, such as grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), has frequently been used to rapidly evaluate the adsorption performance of a large set of MOFs. This allows subsequent experiments to focus only on a small subset of the most promising MOFs. In many instances, however, even molecular simulation becomes prohibitively time consuming, underscoring the need for alternative screening methods, such as machine learning, to precede molecular simulation efforts. In this study, as a proof of concept, we trained a neural network as the first example of a machine learning model capable of predicting full adsorption isotherms of different molecules not included in the training of the model. To achieve this, we trained our neural network only on alchemical species, represented only by their geometry and force field parameters, and used this neural network to predict the loadings of real adsorbates. We focused on predicting room temperature adsorption of small (one- and two-atom) molecules relevant to chemical separations. Namely, argon, krypton, xenon, methane, ethane, and nitrogen. However, we also observed surprisingly promising predictions for more complex molecules, whose properties are outside the range spanned by the alchemical adsorbates.

Nevertheless, for their translation into clinical applications, concerns regarding MOF biocompatibility necessitate comprehensive mitigation. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time-intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a novel computational pipeline guided by machine learning (ML) for probing the biocompatibility of MOFs. The pipeline is designed to expedite the assessment of potential MOF toxicity based on the chemical properties of their precursors. Interpretable ML models were built on a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, predicting the potential toxicity of MOF linkers with 83% accuracy. Additionally, we established a comprehensive database cataloging the toxicity of MOF metallic centers. Leveraging these, we have screened the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) containing 86,000 non-disordered MOFs, identifying existing and future promising candidates with minimal toxicity profiles for drug delivery applications. Beyond high-throughput screening, the developed models shed light on the chemical landscape associated with high biocompatibility precursor molecules, enabling the derivation of guidelines for the rational design of biocompatible MOFs.

By adding a mobile redox acceptor molecule to the electrolyte, the additional cross reaction between the film and the acceptor mimics a source-drain electrode configuration, generating a steady state with negligible counter ion flux. Additionally, we construct a bespoke physical model and derive an analytical expression to correct the current response for any electric field effects.

However, in recent research the vitrification of a number of MOFs has been revealed. We propose that the solid-liquid phase transitions involved in MOF-glass formation can provide unique opportunities for the creation of a new class of functional, stable and porous composite materials. Described herein is the design, synthesis, and characterisation of novel metal-organic framework (MOF) crystal-glass composites, formed by dispersing crystalline MOFs within a MOF-glass matrix. We demonstrate using structural characterisation and analytical electron tomography, that the coordinative bonding and chemical structure of a MIL-53 crystalline phase are preserved within the ZIF-62 glass matrix. Whilst separated phases, the microdomains of each lie close to one another and possess interfacial interactions which improve the mechanical properties of the composite glass. More significantly, the high temperature open pore phase of MIL-53, which spontaneously transforms to a narrow pore upon cooling, is stabilized at room temperature in the crystal-glass composite.

To go beyond standard methodologies, we probe here the transport effects occurring in the material by studying the self-diffusion coefficients of xenon inside the nanopores of framework materials. We find good correlations between the diffusion coefficients and the pore aperture size, as well as other geometrical and energetic descriptors. We used extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the diffusion coefficient of xenon in 4,873 MOFs from the CoREMOF 2019 database, the first large-scale database of transport properties published at this scale.

Our computational workflow includes assembling building blocks and topologies into an initial set of hypothetical MOFs, using genetic algorithms to optimize this initial set for high CO2/N2 selectivity, and further evaluating the top materials through process-level modeling of their performance in a modified Skarstrom cycle. We identify two groups of MOFs that exhibit excellent process performance: one with relatively small pores in the range of 3-5Å and another with larger pores of 6-30Å. The performance of the first group is driven effectively by the exclusion of N2 from adsorption, with binding sites able to accommodate only CO2 molecules. The second group, with larger pores, features binding sites where CO2 molecules form multiple interactions with oxygen and functional groups of several building blocks, leading to high CO2/N2 selectivity.

However, accurately describing their crystallization process remains a significant challenge due to the presence of non-classical pathways. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of a machine-learning approach, overcoming the difficulties associated with bot-tom-up model derivation.

Consequently, the chemical functionality of the catalysts typically governs turnover frequency and selectivity. This study presents an approach harnessing diffusion length to achieve improved selectivity and manipulation of reactant residence time at active sites to augment reaction kinetics. Through the deployment of a thin film composed of a porous metal-organic framework catalyst, we illustrate that how programing reactant diffusion within a cross-flow microfluidic catalytic reactor can concurrently amplify turnover frequency (exceeding 1000-fold) and enhance geometric selectivity (~2-fold) relative to conventional nano/microcrystals of catalyst in one-pot reactor.

Consequently, it is useful to predict whether a MOF is water-stable before investing time and resources into synthesis. Existing heuristics for designing water-stable MOFs lack generality and artificially limit the diversity of explored chemistry due to narrowly defined criteria. Machine learning (ML) models offer the promise to improve generality of predictions but require diverse experimental MOF stability data to be trained. In an improvement on previous efforts, we enlarge the available training data for MOF water stability prediction by over 400%, adding 911 MOFs with water stability labels assigned through semi-automated manuscript analysis to curate the new data set WS24. The additional data is shown to improve ML model performance (test ROC-AUC > 0.8) over diverse chemistry for the prediction of both water stability and stability in harsher acidic conditions. We illustrate how the expanded data set and models can be used with previously developed activation stability models to carry out genetic algorithms to quickly screen ~10,000 MOFs from a space of hundreds of thousands for candidates with multivariate stability (i.e., for activation, in water, and in acid). Model analysis and genetic algorithm results uncover metal- and geometry-specific design rules for robust MOFs. The data set and ML models developed in this work, which we disseminate through an easy-to-use web interface, are expected to contribute toward the accelerated discovery of novel, water-stable MOFs for applications such as direct air gas capture and water treatment.

These materials were applied in several fields such as environmental-based technologies (e.g., water remediation, air purification, gas storage), energy (production of hydrogen, dimethyl ether, solar cells, and supercapacitors), and biomedical sectors (sensing, biosensing, cancer therapy, and drug delivery). They can be used as efficient adsorbents and catalysts to remove emerging contaminants such as metals, dyes, drugs, antibiotics, pesticides, and oils in water via adsorption. They can be also used as catalysts for catalytic degradation, reduction, and oxidation of organic pollutants. They can be used as filters for air purification by capture greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict band gap and adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descrip- tors, such as the Stoichiometric-120 and geometric properties, found here to better represent MOFs in the low data regime, are used to compute the feature space for this model. The partition given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the dataset is used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Through tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets, we show that our method is effective in constructing small training data sets to learn regression models that predict well the target properties, thus reducing the label- ing cost. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data. This offers a unique tool to efficiently analyze complex structure-property relationships in materials and accelerate materials discovery.",0.9231110662675048,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:38:27.557080,False

Predicting the bulk properties from atomistic simulations as well as gas uptakes and adsorption mechanism requires the most accurate definition of MOF systems. The application of ab initio molecular dynamics to these extensive periodic systems exceeds current computational capabilities. Consequently, alternative strategies need to be devised to lower computational costs without compromising accuracy. In this work, we construct high dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP) to describe rotationally and translationally invariant energies and forces of isoreticular metal organic framework (IRMOF) series at the DFT level of accuracy using the fragmentation technique so as to study H2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms considering the flexibility of MOFs during gas adsorption by means of “adsorption relaxation” model in which MD and GCMC simulations were performed simultaneously. Our results showed that classical simulations may diverge from experiments due to the failure of the force field when accounting for flexibility in MOFs whereas our HDNNP follows a much better trend to experimental values. Moreover, we show that the real number of CH4 uptake values of IRMOF-10 can be much more than what classical force field predicts.

To meet the Department of Energy's ambitious goals of achieving 50 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric and 6.5 wt \% gravimetric uptake targets, materials-based approaches are essential. Designing materials that can efficiently store hydrogen gas requires careful tuning of the interactions between the gaseous \ce{H2} and the surface of the material. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials due to their exceptionally high surface areas and tunable structures that can improve gas-framework interactions. However, weak binding enthalpies have limited the success of many current candidates, which fail to achieve even 10 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric uptake at ambient temperatures. To overcome this challenge, We utilized quantum mechanical (QM) based force fields (FF) to investigate the uptake and binding enthalpies of 3 linkers chelated with 7 different transition metals (TM), including both precious metals (Pd and Pt) and first row TM (Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn), to design 24 different COFs in-silico. By applying QM-based FF with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) from 0-700 bar and 298 K, We demonstrated that Co-, Ni-, Mn-, Fe-, Pd-, and Pt-based MSUCOFs can already achieve the Department of Energy's hydrogen storage targets for 2025. Surprisingly, the COFs that incorporated the more affordable and abundant first-row TM often outperformed the precious metals.

Functional properties such as electronic or ionic conductivity can be incorporated into these materials by judicious design of their constituent inorganic and organic building blocks.

However, experimental structural studies of the interfacial regions within metal-organic framework (MOF) composites are extremely challenging. Here, we provide the first example of a new MOF composite family, i.e. using an inorganic glass matrix host in place of the commonly used organic polymers. Crucially, we also decipher atom-atom interactions at the interface. Specifically, we dispersed ZIF-8 within a phosphate glass matrix, and identified interactions at the interface using several different analysis methods of pair distribution function (PDF) and multinuclear multidimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These demonstrated glass-ZIF atom-atom correlations. Additionally, carbon dioxide uptake and stability tests were also performed to check the increment of the surface area and the stability and durability of the material in different media.

Their inherently low mechanical stability, however, frequently renders existing methods of pelletisation ineffective contributing to pore collapse, pore blockage or insufficient densification of crystallites. Here, we present a general process for the shaping and densifying of COFs into centimetre-scale porous monolithic pellets without the need for templates, additives or binders. This process minimises mechanical damage from shear-induced plastic deformation and further provides a network of interparticle mesopores that we exploit in accessing analyte capacities above those achievable from the intrinsic porosity of the COF framework. Using a lattice-gas model, we accurately capture the monolithic structure across the mesoporous range and tie pore architecture to performance characteristics in both gas storage and separation applications.

Structural collapse at high-pressure, and unusual behaviours at elevated temperatures, such as melting and transitions to liquid states, have recently been observed in the family. Here, we show that the effect of the application of simultaneous high-pressure and -temperature on a MOF can be understood in terms of silicate analogues, with crystalline, amorphous and liquid states occurring across the pressure - temperature phase diagram. The response of ZIF-62, the MOF on which we focus, to simultaneous pressure and temperature reveals a complex behaviour with distinct high- and low- density amorphous phases occurring over different regions of the pressure-temperature space. In-situ powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and optical microscopy reveal that the stability of the liquid MOF-state expands significantly towards lower temperatures at intermediate, industrially achievable pressures.

Thousands of MOFs have been synthesized, yet relatively few have been screened for their promise in methane conversion. We developed a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) workflow that identifies MOFs from a diverse space of experimental MOFs that have not been studied for catalysis, yet are thermally stable, synthesizable, and have promising unsaturated metal sites for C–H activation via a terminal metal-oxo species. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical rebound mechanism for methane to methanol conversion on models of the secondary building units (SBUs) from 87 selected MOFs. While we showed that oxo formation favorability decreases with increasing 3d filling, consistent with prior work, previously observed scaling relations between oxo formation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are disrupted by the greater diversity in our MOF set. Accordingly, we focused on Mn MOFs, which favor oxo intermediates without disfavoring HAT or leading to high methanol release energies—a key feature for methane hydroxylation activity. We identified three Mn MOFs comprising unsaturated Mn centers bound to weak-field carboxylate ligands in planar or bent geometries with promising methane to methanol kinetics and thermodynamics.

Advanced computer simulations reveal that, due to their similar interactions with the frame- work, H2O and CO2 molecules compete for the same binding sites, occupying similar void regions within the CALF-20 pores. This competition results in distinct thermodynamic and dynamical behavior of H2O and CO2 molecules, depending on whether one or both guest species are present. Notably, the presence of CO2 molecules forces the H2O molecules to form more connected hydrogen-bond networks within smaller regions, slowing water reorien- tation dynamics and decreasing water entropy. Conversely, the presence of water speeds up the reorientation of CO2 molecules, decreases CO2 entropy, and increases the propensity for CO2 to be adsorbed within the framework due to stronger water-mediated interactions. Due to the competition for the same void spaces, both H2O and CO2 molecules exhibit slower diffusion when molecules of the other guest species are present.

Their exciting properties arise from their modular architectures, which self-assemble from different combinations of metal-based and organic building units. However, the exact mechanisms by which they crystallize remain poorly understood, thus limiting any realisation of real “structure by design”. We report important new insight into MOF formation, gained using <i>in situ </i>X-ray diffraction, <i>p</i>H and turbidity measurements to uncover for the first time the evolution of metastable intermediate species in the canonical zeolitic imidazolate framework system, ZIF-8. We reveal that the intermediate species exist in a dynamic pre-equilibrium prior to network assembly and, depending on the reactant concentrations and the progress of reaction, the pre-equilibrium can be made to favour under- or over-coordinated species, thus accelerating or inhibiting crystallization, respectively. We thereby find that concentration can be effectively used as a synthetic handle to control particle size, with great implications for industrial scale-up and gas sorption applications. These finding enables us to rationalise the apparent contradictions between previous studies and, importantly, opens up new opportunities for the control of crystallization of network solids more generally, from the design of local structure to assembly of particles with precise dimensions.</p>",0.9139819259043044,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:39:15.645570,False

They are  intriguing platforms for the design of porous skeletons with special functionality at the molecular level. However, despite their extraordinary properties, it is difficult to control their electronic properties, thus hindering the potential implementation in electronic devices. A new form of nanoporous material, COFs intercalated with first row transition metal is proposed to address this fundamental drawback - the lack of electronic tunability. Using first-principles calculations, we have designed 31 new COF materials <i>in-silico</i> by intercalating all of the first row transition metals (TMs) with boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs: COF-TM-x (where TM=Sc-Zn and x=3-5). This is a significant addition considering that only 187 experimentally COFs structures has been reported and characterized so far. We have investigated their structure and electronic properties. Specifically, we predict that COF's band gap and density of states (DOSs) can be controlled by intercalating first row transition metal atoms (TM: Sc - Zn) and fine tuned by the concentration of TMs. We also found that the $d$-subshell electron density of the TMs plays the main role in determining the electronic properties of the COFs. Thus intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to control the electronic properties of materials within a porous network. This work opens up new avenues for the design of TM-intercalated materials with promising future applications in nanoporous electronic devices, where a high surface area coupled with fine-tuned electronic properties are desired.</div>",0.9124126886200631,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:39:22.152509,False

But macroscale surface alignment of MOF crystals has only been demonstrated in a few cases. To accelerate the materials discovery process, we have developed a high-throughput computational screening algorithm to identify MOFs that are likely to undergo macroscale aligned heterepitaxial growth on a substrate. Screening of thousands of MOF structures by this process can be achieved in a few days on a desktop workstation. The algorithm filters MOFs based on surface chemical compatibility, lattice matching with the substrate, and interfacial bonding. Our method uses a simple new computationally efficient measure of the interfacial energy that considers both bond and defect formation at the interface. Furthermore, we show that this novel descriptor is a better predictor of aligned heteroepitaxial growth than other established interface descriptors, by testing our screening algorithm on a sample set of copper MOFs that have been grown heteroepitaxially on a copper hydroxide surface. Application of the screening process to several MOF databases reveals that the top candidates for aligned growth on copper hydroxide comprise mostly MOFs  with rectangular lattice symmetry in the plane of the substrate.

To provide a more comprehensive description of the behavior of the hydrocarbon molecules within the MOF-74 cavity, diffusion processes and corresponding diffusion barriers of small hydrocarbons in the MOF-74-Mg were modeled. This work provides a description of the molecular transport processes of CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 within and along the cavity of MOF-74-Mg; in addition, the influence of pre-adsorbed water molecules is also addressed. Density functional theory (DFT), as implemented within a plane-wave (PW) approach under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), has been used to investigate the diffusion mechanisms using the climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method, coupled with the van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) and ultra-soft pseudopotentials. Two transport mechanisms were identified: M1, referring to the molecular migrations within the MOF cavity; and M2, referring to the molecular migrations along the MOF longitudinal channel. The M1 transport mechanism was further analyzed to address the molecular migration from one metal atom to its adjacent one (M1a), and with respect to the second metal over (M1b). All the transport mechanisms considered show that the diffusion of paraffin molecules in MOF-74-Mg is energetically more favorable than that of olefin molecules. An interesting trend is observed across all the diffusion mechanisms where the stronger the molecule binds to the open metal site, the higher the diffusion barrier it needs to overcome. For all the small hydrocarbons considered in this study, transport mechanism M1a is significantly more energetically favorable than M1b, showing that it is easier for molecules to drift along the longitudinal cavity than to remain trapped cross-sectionally within the cavity itself. This work shows how this computational approach can be successfully applied not only to reveal the molecular transport in other MOF-74 isostructural species, but also in the fundamental understanding of the screening of MOFs and other nano-porous materials for gas separation applications.",0.9144971822389337,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 20:40:09.041979,False

Characterization of Metal-Organic Framework Materials ","Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous crystals which are widely used as selective adsorbents, separation membranes, catalysts, gas and energy storage media, and drug delivery vehicles. The unique adsorption and transport properties of MOFs are determined by their complex three-dimensional (3D) networks of pores, cages, and channels, that differ in size, shape, and chemical composition. While the morphological structure of MOF crystals is known, practical MOF materials are rarely ideal crystals. They contain secondary phases, binders, residual chemicals, and various types of defects. It is of paramount importance to evaluate the degree of crystallinity and accessibility of different pore compartments to adsorbing guest molecules. To this end, we recently suggested the method of fingerprint isotherms based on the comparison of the experimentally measured adsorption isotherms and theoretical isotherms on ideal MOF crystals produced by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and decomposed with respect to different pore compartments. In this work, we develop an automated algorithm of pore network compartmentalization that is a prerequisite for calculations of the fingerprint isotherms. The proposed algorithm partitions the unit cell into realistically shaped compartments based on the geometric pore size distribution. The proposed method is demonstrated on several characteristic systems, including Cu-BTC, IRMOF-1, UiO-66, PCN-224, and ZIF-412 and 56 structures from the CoRE MOF database.",0.9130655557287787,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porosity OR pore structure)),2024-11-18 20:40:23.313043,False

Furthermore, these methods are typically designed for single tasks, such as predicting gas adsorption capacity under specific conditions, which restricts the utilization of comprehensive datasets including all adsorption capacities. To address these challenges, we propose Uni-MOF, an innovative framework for large-scale, three-dimensional MOF representation learning, designed for universal multi-gas prediction. Specifically, Uni-MOF serves as a versatile ""gas adsorption detector"" for MOF materials, employing pure three-dimensional representations learned from over 631,000 collected MOF and COF structures.

<p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are
becoming increasingly popular as heterogenous support matrices for molecular
catalysts. Given that reactants, or potentially holes/electrons, need to
diffuse into the porous framework as the reaction proceeds, the reaction can
possibly take place within the bulk of the particle or be confined to a thin
layer at the surface due to transport limitations. Herein, a simple
steady-state reaction-diffusion kinetic model is developed to diagnose these
two mutually exclusive behaviors in MOF-based systems. The oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) driven by a chemical oxidant is presented as an example
mechanism. Quantitative metrics for assigning either bulk or surface reactivity
are delineated over a wide variety of conditions, and numerical simulations are
employed to verify these results. For each case, expressions for the turnover frequency
(TOF) are outlined, and it is shown that surface reactivity can influence
measured TOFs. Importantly, this report shows how to transition from surface to
bulk reactivity and thus identifies which experimental parameters to target for

In this study, we enhance the performance of LLMs in the specific field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage by employing a post-pretraining approach to customize the LLM with domain-specific learning. By incorporating a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 2,000 MOF structures, over 7,000 related scientific papers, and a corpus exceeding 210 million tokens of specialized materials and chemical knowledge, we developed a domain-specific LLM for MOFs, referred to as MOFs-LLM. Through supervised fine-tuning, we unlocked the potential of MOFs-LLM in various tasks, including performance prediction, inverse design, mechanistic studies and application prospect analysis, with a specific focus on hydrogen storage material design challenges. In the practical application of reverse design, we utilize MOFs-LLM to mutate numerous ligands and select suitable building blocks, resulting in a structural space encompassing more than 100,000 MOFs. A MOF structure with highly promising hydrogen storage performance was ultimately successfully identified.

Computational quantum chemical calculations can aid in this quest. To set the stage, we review general thermodynamic considerations that control the usable storage capacity of a sorbent. We then discuss cluster modeling of \ce{H2} ligation at MOF binding sites using state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and how the binding can be understood using energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Employing these tools, we illustrate the connections between the character of the MOF binding site and the associated adsorption thermodynamics using four experimentally characterized MOFs, highlighting the role of open metal sites (OMSs) in accessing binding strengths relevant to room temperature storage.

Substrate transport rates in these materials can significantly influence the efficiency of such applications. Two factors that contribute to transport rates include 1) the porosity of the silicate matrix and
2) non-bonding interactions between the diffusing species and the silicate surface. These contributions generally emerge from disparate length scales, namely 'microscopic' (roughly nanometer-scale) and 'macroscopic' (roughly micron-scale), respectively. Here, we develop a simulation framework to estimate the simultaneous impact of these factors on methane mass transport in silicate channels.
Specifically, we develop a model of methane transport using homogenization theory to obtain transport parameters valid at length scales of hundreds to thousands of nanometers.
These parameters implicitly reflect interactions taking place at fractions of a nanometer. The inputs to the homogenization analysis are data from extensive molecular dynamics simulations that incorporate atomistic-scale interactions, processed to yield local diffusion coefficients and mean force potentials. With this model, we demonstrate how nuances in silicate hydration and silica/methane interactions impact methane diffusion rates in silicate materials, including the effects of silicate surface chemistry such as the presence of silanol groups.
The molecular dynamics simulations indicate that methane diffusivity at the silica surface is lower than the bulk-like rates observed at the center of channels of sufficient width.
However, potentials of mean force generally evidence attractive methane/silica interactions that enhance diffusion overall. By simultaneously accounting for both of these effects, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient for the nanoporous silicate can be approximately double the value of estimates assuming fully bulk-like behavior in the channel. This study therefore demonstrates the importance of determining diffusion coefficients and potentials of mean force at an atomistic level when estimating transport properties in bulk materials.
Importantly, we provide a simple homogenization framework to incorporate these molecular-scale attributes into bulk material transport estimates. This hybrid homogenization/molecular dynamics approach will be of general use for describing small molecule transport in materials with detailed molecular interactions.

A crucial aspect of BO is how molecules and materials are represented as feature vectors, where both the completeness and compactness of these representations can influence the efficiency of the optimization process. Traditionally, a fixed representation is chosen by expert chemists or applying data-driven feature selection methods on available labelled datasets. However, when dealing with novel optimization tasks, prior knowledge or large datasets are often unavailable, and relying on these even can introduce bias into the search process. In this work, we demonstrate a Feature Adaptive Bayesian Optimization (FABO) framework, which integrates feature selection in the Bayesian optimization process to dynamically adapt material representations throughout the optimization cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive approach across several molecular optimization tasks, including the discovery of high-performing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three distinct tasks, each involving unique property distributions and requiring a distinct representation. Our results show that the adaptive nature of the representation leads to outperforming random search baseline and scenarios where prior knowledge of the feature space is available. Notably, for known optimization tasks, FABO automatically identifies representations that are aligned with human chemical intuition, validating its utility for optimization tasks where such insights are not available in advance.

These calculations can frequently lead to a null result, e.g., the calculation does not converge or the molecule does not stay intact during a geometry optimization. To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of  deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on non- productive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data.

Several different methods have been employed to find new types of materials, ranging from the arbitrary replacement of atoms in a crystal structure to advanced machine learning methods
for predicting entirely new crystal structures. In this work, we pursue three primary objectives. I) Introduce CrysTens, a crystal encoding that can be used in a wide variety of deep-learning generative models. II) Investigate and analyze the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models to find an innovative and
effective way of generating theoretical crystal structures that are synthesizable and stable. III) Show that the models that have a better “understanding” of the structure of CrysTens produce more symmetrical and realistic crystals and exhibit a better apprehension of the dataset as
a whole. We accomplish these objectives using over fifty thousand Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) from Pearson’s Crystal Database.

Stable metal-oxo species have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating the development of structure-property relationships. To overcome these challenges, we train the first machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting metal-oxo formation energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states. Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel ridge regression or artificial neural network ML models, we achieve good mean absolute errors (4-5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations. Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance of non-local, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing both expected trends in oxo formation energetics, such as destabilization of the metal-oxo species with increasing <i>d</i>-filling, as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity. We carry out uncertainty aware evolutionary optimization using the ANN to explore a > 37,000 candidate catalyst space. New metal and oxidation state combinations are uncovered and validated with density functional theory (DFT), including counter-intuitive oxo-formation energies for oxidatively stable complexes. This approach doubles the density of confirmed DFT leads in originally sparsely populated regions of property space, highlighting the potential of ML-model-driven discovery to uncover catalyst design rules and exceptions.</p>",0.9151211674064565,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porosity OR pore structure)),2024-11-18 20:46:36.153138,False

New theoretical approaches are needed to gauge the catalytic activity of high-entropy alloys and optimize the alloy composition within a feasible time frame as a prerequisite for further experimental studies.
Herein, we establish a workflow for simulations of catalysis on high-entropy alloy surfaces. For each step of the modeling we present our choice of method, however, we also acknowledge that alternative options are available.
We apply the developed methodology to predict the net catalytic activity of any alloy composition, within the composition space spanned by Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru, for the oxygen reduction reaction. Based on first-principle calculations, a graph convolution neural network is used to predict adsorption energies of *OH and *O. Subsequently, taking competitive co-adsorption of reaction intermediates into account, we couple the net adsorption energy distribution of a high-entropy alloy surface to the expected current density. Lastly, this procedure is used in conjunction with a Bayesian optimization scheme to search for optimal alloy compositions, which yields several promising compositions.
This result shows that an unbiased in silico pre-screening and discovery of catalyst candidates is viable and will help scale the otherwise insurmountable challenge of searching for high-entropy alloy catalysts.

To address the challenges related to the preparation, study and optimization of HEAs, machine learning solutions are attractive. In this paper, the composition of PtRuPdRhAu hydrogen oxidation catalysts is optimized for the CO oxidation reaction. This is achieved by constructing a dataset using Bayesian optimization as guidance. For this quinary nanomaterial, the best performing composition was found within the first 35 experiments. However, the dataset was expanded until a total of 68 samples were investigated. This final dataset was used to construct a random forest regression model and a linear model.

are important to many chemical processes. Leading terms in these forces are
often modeled using polarizabilities and C<sub>n</sub> (n=6, 8, 9, 10 …)
dispersion coefficients. Force fields for classical atomistic simulations can
be constructed using atom-in-material dispersion coefficients and
polarizabilities. This article addresses the key question of how to efficiently
assign these parameters to constituent atoms in a material so that properties
of the whole material are better reproduced. We develop a new set of scaling
laws and computational algorithms (called MCLF) to do this in an accurate and
computationally efficient manner across diverse material types. We introduce a
conduction limit upper bound and m-scaling to describe the different behaviors
of surface and buried atoms. We validate MCLF by comparing results to
high-level benchmarks for isolated neutral and charged atoms, diverse diatomic
molecules, various polyatomic molecules (e.g., polyacenes, fullerenes, and
small organic and inorganic molecules), and dense solids (including metallic,
covalent, and ionic). MCLF provides the non-directionally screened
polarizabilities required to construct force fields, the directionally-screened
static polarizability tensor components and eigenvalues, and environmentally
screened C<sub>6</sub> coefficients. Overall, MCLF has improved accuracy and
lower computational cost than the TS-SCS method. For TS-SCS, we compared charge
partitioning methods and show DDEC6 partitioning yields more accurate results
than Hirshfeld partitioning. MCLF also gives approximations for C<sub>8</sub>,
C<sub>9</sub>, and C<sub>10</sub> dispersion coefficients and Quantum Drude
Oscillator parameters. For sufficiently large systems, our method’s required
computational time and memory scale linearly with increasing system size. This
is a huge improvement over the cubic computational time of direct matrix
inversion. As demonstrations, we study an ice crystal containing >250,000
atoms in the unit cell and the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme complexed with
an inhibiter molecule. This method should find widespread applications to
