By combining computational modeling with machine learning algorithms, we investigate how different structural parameters can be tuned to enhance diffusion rates. Our methodology involves training machine learning models on a dataset of MOFs and COFs with varying diffusivity properties, allowing us to identify patterns and correlations between structure and behavior. The results show that machine learning-based optimization can significantly improve the diffusion properties of MOFs and COFs, leading to enhanced performance in applications such as gas separation and catalysis. Our findings have important implications for the design and synthesis of new materials with tailored properties, enabling more efficient and effective use of these frameworks in various industrial processes.'}","""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks);(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porosity OR pore structure))",0,155,2:00:00.087918
