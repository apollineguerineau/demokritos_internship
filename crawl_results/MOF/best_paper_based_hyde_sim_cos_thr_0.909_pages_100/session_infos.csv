Start by analyzing the initial query and then consider how the titles provided can enhance the context. Generate an improved query by adding one or more related terms, synonyms, or key variations that reflect a broader or more specific focus based on both the original query and the page titles. Your goal is to optimize the query for retrieving more relevant search results. This is the initial query : {}. And this is the three relevant page titles : {}. Please generate a new expanded boolean query that integrates these insights. The response must be in JSON format, with the key ""expanded_query"" and for value the suggested expansion.

This study employs machine learning techniques to predict and optimize surface functionalization strategies for MOFs, with a focus on improving diffusivity. By integrating machine learning algorithms with computational simulations, we successfully identified a set of optimal surface functional groups that enhance gas separation efficiency by up to 30%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in accelerating the design and development of next-generation MOFs for industrial applications. This research contributes to the growing field of materials science and provides valuable insights into the optimization of MOF architectures for improved diffusion properties.'}","""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks);Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanomaterials OR adsorption OR sorption)",0,159,2:01:30.290114
