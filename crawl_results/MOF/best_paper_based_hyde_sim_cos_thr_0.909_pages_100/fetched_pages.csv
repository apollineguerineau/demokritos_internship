However, the potential of AI to work backwards, towards predicting/designing a finetuned material for a given separation, remains untapped. Recent works report the inverse design of functionalized materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but they are limited to targeted sorption properties, while diffusivity, D, which is the driving force in membrane-based separations, is omitted. Herein, we report a tool combining a biologically inspired evolutionary algorithm with machine learning to design fine-tuned Zeolitic-Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-family of MOFs, for desired sets of diffusivities (Di, Di/Dj) values of any given mixture of species i and j. We moreover display the efficacy of our tool, by designing ZIFs that meet industrial performance criteria of permeability and selectivity, for CO2/CH4, O2/N2 and C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. We validate the designed ZIFs through appropriate simulations, confirming the suitability of the AI-suggested ZIF designs.",0.9277193332613333,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:56:29.427270,False

The overwhelming majority of the studies is focused on propylene/propane separation. Nevertheless, as the ultimate goal is to obtain propylene as the end product, propylene-selective MOFs necessitate a demanding and complex desorption process, which consumes a substantial amount of energy and involves intricate operations. Consequently, having an adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs propane instead would be more advantageous. This approach would enable the production of high-purity propylene in a single step and lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and the quantity of adsorbent required. The Computation-Ready Experimental Metal-Organic Framework (CoRE MOF) 2019 database is utilized for the computational screening of flexible MOFs using molecular dynamics simulations to identify materials with strong potential for separating propane/propylene via self-diffusion. This screening process is the first to fully consider the impact of framework flexibility on the discovery of guest self-diffusion coefficients. The study underscores the significance of accounting for framework flexibility in investigations of gas molecules transport in MOFs, showcases the potential of using data-driven approaches to identify high-performance materials, and suggests methods for enhancing the predictive capabilities of screening workflows.  The top 5 MOFs from the CoRE MOF database for propane and propylene separation at a temperature of 298 K are identified. It is observed that the presence of carbonyl groups greatly enhances the separation properties between propane and propylene. Subsequently, a machine learning approach is utilized to develop a model and uncover important features. The machine learning model's predicted values for self-diffusion are reasonably consistent with the data obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.",0.9245943953269705,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:56:30.047303,False

Building upon and extending the comparative analysis, our investigation underscores the CATBoost model's remarkable predictive prowess, characterized by a significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) and an enhanced R-squared (R²) value, thereby affirming its superior accuracy and reliability in forecasting CO2 adsorption. A pivotal aspect of our research is the integration of SHAP values for a detailed assessment of feature importance, which not only corroborated 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area' as pivotal determinants of CO2 uptake but also illuminated the model's advanced analytical capabilities in handling categorical features and mitigating overfitting, even within a dataset marked by intricate and non-linear patterns. Our quantitative and conceptual analysis, showcasing up to a 15% improvement in (RMSE) over previous models, reveals the CATBoost model’s unparalleled efficiency in discerning the multifaceted interplay of factors influencing CO2 adsorption. This is crucial for the strategic engineering of MOFs with optimized properties. Beyond 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area', our SHAP analysis highlighted other descriptors with substantial values, elucidating their nuanced contributions to CO2 uptake and providing invaluable insights for the MOF design process.

Owing to their high surface area, porosity, and tunability, MOFs have received significant attention for numerous applications such as gas separation and storage. Atomistic simulations and data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) have been successfully employed to screen large databases and successfully develop new experimentally synthesized and validated MOFs for CO2 capture. To enable data-driven materials discovery for any application, the first (and arguably most crucial) step is database curation. This work introduces the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC-MOF) database. This is a database of ~280,000 MOFs which have been either experimentally characterized or computationally generated, spanning all publicly available MOF databases. A key feature of ARC-MOF is that it contains DFT-derived electrostatic potential fitted partial atomic charges for each MOF. Additionally, ARC-MOF contains pre-computed descriptors for out-of-the-box machine learning applications. An in-depth analysis of the diversity of ARC-MOF with respect to the currently mapped design space of MOFs was performed – a critical, yet commonly overlooked aspect of previously reported MOF databases. Using this analysis, balanced subsets from ARC-MOF for various machine learning purposes have been identified.

The intrinsic length and time scales often stretch far beyond the nanometer and picosecond range due to e.g. large spatial heterogeneities or complex phase transitions. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can extend the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) towards such challenging systems,  but the generation of a representative training set of atomic configurations still poses a major challenge. In this work, we present an incremental learning scheme that constructs accurate and transferable MLPs based on a minimal number of DFT evaluations. Key to the approach is a combination of an active learning scheme that generates systematically improved MLPs with efficient and parallelized enhanced sampling protocols that explore increasingly larger portions of the phase space and learn physical interactions on-the-fly. The method requires a single atomic structure and a collective variable as input, after which the incremental learning approach constructs accurate interatomic potentials based on as few as 1000 single point DFT evaluations, even for flexible frameworks with multiple structurally different phases. The accuracy of the obtained potentials is extensively validated in terms of structural and mechanical properties across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, yielding thermodynamically transferable MLPs. Finally, it is demonstrated how the incremental learning approach shows great potential to train universal MLPs for a larger set of materials. A proof of principle based on 10 well-known aluminum- and zirconium-based MOFs is shown. The proposed incremental learning approach is universally applicable and may induce a paradigm shift in both the accuracy as well as the time and length scale of computational models for framework materials.",0.9233670699984704,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:56:33.038029,False

In this study, we present a novel approach to further enhance the properties of porous polymer membranes emerging from MOFs through crosslinking of the organic linker molecules and subsequent metal-atom removal. To ensure reproducibility of the multi-step synthesis process and high quality of the resulting polymeric membranes, we automated the process and followed a machine learning optimization approach. The high-quality MOF-thin films (SURMOFs) were prepared in a layer-by-layer fashion directly on gold-coated porous alumina substrates. This direct synthesis proved crucial to preserve the structural integrity of the membranes and thus avoiding defect formation caused by a substrate-transfer process, which is usually required when advanced materials are used to fabricate a membrane. The initial SURMOF membrane exhibits moderate gas separation performance, once crosslinked, its gas selectivity could be significantly enhanced although with the compromise of lower gas permeance. Interestingly, once we removed the metal centers and thereby converted the SURMOF into a purely organic polymeric membrane, the membrane gas permeance could be restored almost to its initial condition while preserving the enhanced selectivities. In particular, the resulting polymeric membrane outperforms most commercially available polymer membranes for H2 /CO2 gas separation.

The presence of open metal sites (OMS) significantly influences the catalytic, adsorption, and separation capabilities of MOFs. However, common laboratory methods are indirect and can suffer from structural heterogeneity. Computational methods, including machine learning, play a central role in the rational design of MOFs, yet in silico detection of OMS still relies heavily on computationally expensive simulations. In this work, we use extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) and random forest (RF) methods to predict the existence of OMS in various MOF compounds based on structural and chemical features. RF provided a higher prediction accuracy of 0.891 compared to 0.865 of XGBoost. Average ionization energy, average electron affinity, and fraction of electrons in d orbitals exhibited the highest importance scores across the two models. These prediction models not only provide novel insights into the structural-property relationship between MOFs and OMS, but also would enable accurate and efficient exploration of MOFs that would give rise to OMS, facilitating the engineering of sorption, separation, and catalytic properties.

MFMs have a wide variety of potential and realised adsorption applications. In order to design an ideal framework material for a particular application, the composition of molecular fragments is not the only factor, but the arrangement of the those fragments is also important, especially when the fragments (molecular building blocks) are chemically functionalised and lack symmetry. As has been observed in Metal Organic Frameworks, the flexibility and absorption properties may differ greatly when altering the orientation of the building units or changing the position of functional groups. However, although the position of functional group has a great influence on a targeted property, studies on functional group arrangements have only been performed on a small set of MOF structures.

In this contribution, we develop a fingerprint/descriptor for optimising functionalised molecular framework structures using machine learning. We begin from  the  perspective of a molecular framework structure described as a collection of discrete pore shapes. To describe the chemical environment of the pore, we derive a fingerprint based on the occurrence of pairwise distances between functional groups in each pore. We present the possibilities of functional group arrangements in the 14 most common pore shapes, created by ditopic (2-connected) linkers are presented. The method to enumerate and identify possible isomers is explained.

For example, in a carbon capture process, the heat required to regenerate a solid sorbent is directly related to the heat capacity of the material. However, for most materials suitable for carbon capture applications the heat capacity is not known, and thus the standard procedure is to assume the same value for all materials. In this work, we developed a machine-learning approach to accurately predict the heat capacity of these materials, i.e., zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent-organic frameworks. The accuracy of our prediction is confirmed with novel experimental data. Finally, for a temperature swing adsorption process that captures carbon from the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant, we show that for some materials the heat requirement is reduced by as much as a factor of two using the correct heat capacity.",0.9146358515032512,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:56:36.357122,False

Traditional simulation approaches, such as molecular dynamics, are complex and computationally demanding. Although feature engineering-based machine learning methods perform better, they are susceptible to overfitting because of limited labeled data. Furthermore, these methods are typically designed for single tasks, such as predicting gas adsorption capacity under specific conditions, which restricts the utilization of comprehensive datasets including all adsorption capacities. To address these challenges, we propose Uni-MOF, an innovative framework for large-scale, three-dimensional MOF representation learning, designed for universal multi-gas prediction. Specifically, Uni-MOF serves as a versatile ""gas adsorption detector"" for MOF materials, employing pure three-dimensional representations learned from over 631,000 collected MOF and COF structures. Our experimental results show that Uni-MOF can automatically extract structural representations and predict adsorption capacities under various operating conditions using a single model. For simulated data, Uni-MOF exhibits remarkably high predictive accuracy across all datasets. Impressively, the values predicted by Uni-MOF correspond with the outcomes of adsorption experiments.

However, the complex role played by the reaction parameters in controlling the size and morphology of ZIF-8 particles is still not fully understood. Even further, many individual reports propose different nucleation and growth mechanisms for ZIF-8, thus creating a fragmented view of the system's behavior. To provide a unified view, we have generated a comprehensive dataset of synthetic conditions and their final outputs and applied Machine Learning techniques to analyze the data. Our approach has enabled us to identify the nucleation and growth mechanisms operating for ZIF-8 in a given portion of the chemical space and to reveal the underlying impact of synthetic variables on the final particle size and morphology.

However, compared to other porous materials, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks, the successful integration of hierarchical porosity into COFs remains largely unexplored. The challenge lies in identifying appropriate synthetic methods to introduce secondary pores without compromising the intrinsic structural porosity of COFs. In this study, we realize a template-induced synthetic methodology to facilitate the construction of hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs). This novel approach utilizes commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as a hard template, enabling us to increase the total pore volume of a series of β-ketoenamine-linked COFs as well as an imine-based COF while preserving their surface areas. In addition to transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption analyses, small-angle X-ray scattering and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were employed to investigate the hierarchical porosity and diffusivity of guest molecules within hCOFs.

While machine learning (ML) has been leveraged to aid the design or screen of MOFs for different purposes, the needs of big data are not always met, limiting the applicability of ML models trained against small data sets. In this work, we introduce a transfer learning technique to improve the accuracy and applicability of ML models trained with small amount of MOF adsorption data. This technique leverages potentially shareable knowledge from a source task to improve the models on the target tasks. As demonstrations, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data with 13,506 MOF structures at 100 bar and 243 K is used as the source task. When transferring knowledge from the source task to H<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 100 bar and 130 K (one target task), the predictive accuracy on target task was improved from 0.960 (direct training) to 0.991 (transfer learning). We also tested transfer learning across different gas species (i.e. from H<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>), with predictive accuracy of CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption being improved from 0.935 (direct training) to 0.980 (transfer learning). Based on further analysis, transfer learning will always work on the target tasks with low generalizability. However, when transferring the knowledge from the source task to Xe/Kr adsorption, the transfer learning does not improve the predictive accuracy, which is attributed to the lack of common descriptors that is key to the underlying knowledge.  <b></b></p>",0.9222842580973794,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:56:47.838311,False

Nevertheless, for their translation into clinical applications, concerns regarding MOF biocompatibility necessitate comprehensive mitigation. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time-intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a novel computational pipeline guided by machine learning (ML) for probing the biocompatibility of MOFs. The pipeline is designed to expedite the assessment of potential MOF toxicity based on the chemical properties of their precursors. Interpretable ML models were built on a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, predicting the potential toxicity of MOF linkers with 83% accuracy. Additionally, we established a comprehensive database cataloging the toxicity of MOF metallic centers. Leveraging these, we have screened the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) containing 86,000 non-disordered MOFs, identifying existing and future promising candidates with minimal toxicity profiles for drug delivery applications. Beyond high-throughput screening, the developed models shed light on the chemical landscape associated with high biocompatibility precursor molecules, enabling the derivation of guidelines for the rational design of biocompatible MOFs.

We present a database of 948 experimentally measured pure-component C2 isotherms from 192 MOFs gathered from the literature and use it to train machine learning models to predict MOF ethane and ethylene uptake across a range of temperature and pressure conditions.

To remedy this, we employ an alternative method based on steady-state cyclic voltammetry. By adding a mobile redox acceptor molecule to the electrolyte, the additional cross reaction between the film and the acceptor mimics a source-drain electrode configuration, generating a steady state with negligible counter ion flux. Additionally, we construct a bespoke physical model and derive an analytical expression to correct the current response for any electric field effects.

Consequently, it is useful to predict whether a MOF is water-stable before investing time and resources into synthesis. Existing heuristics for designing water-stable MOFs lack generality and artificially limit the diversity of explored chemistry due to narrowly defined criteria. Machine learning (ML) models offer the promise to improve generality of predictions but require diverse experimental MOF stability data to be trained. In an improvement on previous efforts, we enlarge the available training data for MOF water stability prediction by over 400%, adding 911 MOFs with water stability labels assigned through semi-automated manuscript analysis to curate the new data set WS24. The additional data is shown to improve ML model performance (test ROC-AUC > 0.8) over diverse chemistry for the prediction of both water stability and stability in harsher acidic conditions.

Sorption processes are typically modeled by means of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. However, GCMC methods are limited to physisorption processes described by molecular-mechanics, or, classical, interatomic potentials. Therefore, a computationally efficient GCMC method that accounts for chemisorption is needed. Here, we report hybrid interatomic potentials that are specifically designed for GCMC simulations of chemisorption. Namely, the sorbate-sorbate interaction is described by classical potentials and the sorbate-sorbent interaction is rendered by a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on simulation data extracted from quantum calculations. To prove the principal, we have applied the method to the simulation of \ce{CO2} chemisorption in the porous metal-organic framework Mg-MOF-74. By comparing the GCMC simulated \ce{CO2} adsorption isotherms and isobars, respectively, with the experimental data, we obtain better agreement compared to other classical and quantum-chemical simulation methods while keeping computational cost at a minimum. With the rise of transferable MLIP, we expect that the method could enable computationally efficient and highly accurate sorption studies in reticular materials.

MOFs, hailed for their modular architecture, offer unmatched flexibility in customising functionalities to meet specific application needs. However, navigating this chemical space to identify optimal MOF structures poses a significant challenge. Tradtional high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), while useful, is often limited by a distribution bias towards materials not aligned with the desired functionalities. To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a ”deep dreaming” methodology to optimise MOFs in silico, aiming to generate structures with systematically shifted properties that are closer to target functionalities from the outset. Our methodology
integrates property prediction and structure optimisation within a single interpretable framework, leveraging a specialised chemical language model augmented with attention mechanisms. Focusing on a curated set of MOF properties critical to applications like carbon capture and energy storage, our approach not only expands the selection of potential materials for HTCS but also opens new avenues for material exploration and development.

By a first-of-its-kind study utilizing data-driven algorithms and high-throughput experimentation (HTE) in MOF catalysis, yields on Cu-deposited NU-1000 were improved from 4.2% to 24.4%. Characterization of the most-performant catalysts reveal conversion to hexadiene to be due to the formation of large Cu nanoparticles, which is further supported by reaction mechanisms calculated with density functional theory (DFT). Our results demonstrate both the strengths and weaknesses of the HTE approach. As a strength, HTE excels at being able to find interesting and novel catalytic activity; any a priori theoretical approach would be hard-pressed to find success, as high-performing catalysts required highly specific operating conditions difficult to model theoretically, and initial naïve single-atom models of the active site did not prove representative of the nanoparticle catalysts responsible for conversion to hexadiene. As a weakness, our results show how the HTE approach must be designed and monitored carefully to find success; in our initial campaign (~six months and over half of the total experiments conducted) only minor catalytic performances (up to 4.2% yield) were achieved, which was only improved following a complete overhaul of our HTE approach and questioning our initial assumptions.

Predicting the bulk properties from atomistic simulations as well as gas uptakes and adsorption mechanism requires the most accurate definition of MOF systems. The application of ab initio molecular dynamics to these extensive periodic systems exceeds current computational capabilities. Consequently, alternative strategies need to be devised to lower computational costs without compromising accuracy. In this work, we construct high dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP) to describe rotationally and translationally invariant energies and forces of isoreticular metal organic framework (IRMOF) series at the DFT level of accuracy using the fragmentation technique so as to study H2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms considering the flexibility of MOFs during gas adsorption by means of “adsorption relaxation” model in which MD and GCMC simulations were performed simultaneously. Our results showed that classical simulations may diverge from experiments due to the failure of the force field when accounting for flexibility in MOFs whereas our HDNNP follows a much better trend to experimental values. Moreover, we show that the real number of CH4 uptake values of IRMOF-10 can be much more than what classical force field predicts.

In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict band gap and adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descrip- tors, such as the Stoichiometric-120 and geometric properties, found here to better represent MOFs in the low data regime, are used to compute the feature space for this model. The partition given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the dataset is used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Through tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets, we show that our method is effective in constructing small training data sets to learn regression models that predict well the target properties, thus reducing the label- ing cost. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data.

However, identifying the best applications for new materials remains a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate a multimodal approach that uses the information available as soon as a MOF is synthesized, specifically its powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) and the chemicals used in its synthesis, to predict its potential properties and uses. By self-supervised pretraining of this model on crystal structures accessible from MOF databases, our model achieves accurate predictions for various properties, across pore structure, chemistry-reliant, and quantum-chemical properties. We further assess the robustness of this method in the presence of experimental measurement imperfections. Utilizing this approach, we create a synthesis-to-application map for MOFs, offering insights into optimal material classes for diverse applications. Finally, by augmenting this model with a recommendation system, we identify promising MOFs for applications that are different from the originally reported applications.

To meet the Department of Energy's ambitious goals of achieving 50 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric and 6.5 wt \% gravimetric uptake targets, materials-based approaches are essential. Designing materials that can efficiently store hydrogen gas requires careful tuning of the interactions between the gaseous \ce{H2} and the surface of the material. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials due to their exceptionally high surface areas and tunable structures that can improve gas-framework interactions. However, weak binding enthalpies have limited the success of many current candidates, which fail to achieve even 10 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric uptake at ambient temperatures. To overcome this challenge, We utilized quantum mechanical (QM) based force fields (FF) to investigate the uptake and binding enthalpies of 3 linkers chelated with 7 different transition metals (TM), including both precious metals (Pd and Pt) and first row TM (Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn), to design 24 different COFs in-silico.

Organic-based materials on the other hand can provide an attractive alternative, potentially yielding sustainable, safe, and cost-effective energy storage devices based on abundant elements (e.g. C, N, O, S, and H). However, attempts to incorporate organic and coordination compounds so far have led to sub-par cycling stability and charging rates due to insufficient structural and (electro)chemical stability, low electrical conductivity, and reduced performance at industrially relevant device scales.
In recent years metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained attention as having the potential to rival or even supersede traditional energy storage materials. Functional properties such as electronic or ionic conductivity can be incorporated into these materials by judicious design of their constituent inorganic and organic building blocks. However, full realization of the potential of MOFs for electrochemical energy storage requires joint expertise from distinct fields. In particular, bridges must be formed between electrochemists and synthetic and material chemists to establish the unified approach necessary to develop MOF-based energy storage devices exhibiting competitive performance.

			<div>
				<div>
					<p>In nanoporous materials, guest–host interactions affect the properties and function of
both adsorbent and adsorbate molecules. Due to their structural and chemical diversity, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a common class of nanoporous materials, have
been shown to be able to efficiently and, often, selectively adsorb various types of guest
molecules. In this study, we characterize the structure and dynamics of water confined
in ZIF-90. Through the integration of experimental and computational infrared (IR)  spectroscopy, we probe the structure of heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) adsorbed in the pores,
disentangling the fundamental framework–water and water–water interactions. The experimental IR spectrum of D<sub>2</sub>O in ZIF-90 displays a blue-shifted OD-stretch band
compared to liquid D<sub>2</sub>O. The analysis of the IR spectra simulated at both classical
and quantum levels indicates that the D<sub>2</sub>O molecules preferentially interact with the
carbonyl groups of the framework and highlights the importance of including nuclear
quantum effects and taking into account Fermi resonances for a correct interpretation
of the OD-stretch band in terms of the underlying hydrogen-bonding motifs. Through
a systematic comparison with the experimental spectra, we demonstrate that computational spectroscopy can be used to gain quantitative, molecular-level insights into
framework–water interactions that determine the water adsorption capacity of MOFs
as well as the spatial arrangements of the water molecules inside the MOF pores which,
in turn, are key to the design of MOF-based materials for water harvesting.</p>

Compared to more accurate hybrid functionals, we find that the widely used PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional severely underpredicts MOF band gaps in a largely systematic manner for semi-conductors and insulators without magnetic character. However, an even larger and less predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations. With regards to partial atomic charges, we find that different density functional approximations predict similar charges overall, although hybrid functionals tend to shift electron density away from the metal centers and onto the ligand environments compared to the GGA point of reference. Much more significant differences in partial atomic charges are observed when comparing different charge partitioning schemes. We conclude by using the new dataset of computed MOF properties to train machine learning models that can rapidly predict MOF band gaps for all four density functional approximations considered in this work, paving the way for future high-throughput screening studies.

While the morphological structure of MOF crystals is known, practical MOF materials are rarely ideal crystals.

Notably, the presence of CO2 molecules forces the H2O molecules to form more connected hydrogen-bond networks within smaller regions, slowing water reorien- tation dynamics and decreasing water entropy. Conversely, the presence of water speeds up the reorientation of CO2 molecules, decreases CO2 entropy, and increases the propensity for CO2 to be adsorbed within the framework due to stronger water-mediated interactions.

<p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are
becoming increasingly popular as heterogenous support matrices for molecular
catalysts. Given that reactants, or potentially holes/electrons, need to
diffuse into the porous framework as the reaction proceeds, the reaction can
possibly take place within the bulk of the particle or be confined to a thin
layer at the surface due to transport limitations. Herein, a simple
steady-state reaction-diffusion kinetic model is developed to diagnose these
two mutually exclusive behaviors in MOF-based systems. The oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) driven by a chemical oxidant is presented as an example
mechanism. Quantitative metrics for assigning either bulk or surface reactivity
are delineated over a wide variety of conditions, and numerical simulations are
employed to verify these results. For each case, expressions for the turnover frequency
(TOF) are outlined, and it is shown that surface reactivity can influence
measured TOFs. Importantly, this report shows how to transition from surface to
bulk reactivity and thus identifies which experimental parameters to target for
optimizing the efficiency of MOF-based molecular catalyst systems.</p>

Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were combined with ideal adsorption process simulation to computationally screen 14,000 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for adsorptive separation of SF$_6$ \/ N$_2$. More than 150 high-performing MOFs were identified based on the GCMC simulations at the pressure and vacuum swing conditions, and subsequently evaluated using the ideal adsorption process simulation. High-performing MOFs selected for the VSA conditions are able to achieve the 90 \% target purity level of SF$_6$, but none of the selected MOFs for PSA conditions could. Cascade PSA configuration was proposed and adopted to improve the purity level of the separated SF$_6$. Cascade PSA configuration was also adopted to improve the purity. In the pump efficiency scenarios of 80, 20, and 10 \%, the VSA and cascade PSA cases were compared.

The rational design of MOFs relies on accurate computational modeling, with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations frequently employed to model gas uptake. In GCMC simulations, interatomic interactions are typically described using force fields, but no single existing force field can fully capture the diverse chemical environments present in MOFs. Refining force field parameters using density functional theory (DFT) provides a more accurate, ab initio-level description of interatomic interactions. In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of the widely used Universal Force Field (UFF) by comparing its predictions with experimental isotherms for four representative adsorbates, H2, CO2, C2H4, and C2H6, across 379 isotherms from 142 MOFs. The results show that UFF consistently overestimates gas uptake in GCMC simulations. To provide a customized force field for each MOF, we present a practical scheme for fitting force field parameters to DFT-calculated energies for a large set of MOFs. The refined force field successfully reproduces the DFT-calculated interaction energy, effectively correcting UFF’s overestimation of interatomic repulsion. However, because UFF overestimates gas uptake, and the refined force field reduces repulsion further, this refinement amplifies the overestimation.

Over three laboratory periods, undergraduate students received instructions for synthesizing four MOFs. They were given the freedom to choose which MOF to synthesize and use for capture of either methylene blue or iodine. This hands-on experience exposed students to techniques not typically explored in general chemistry, including the use of crystallographic information files to examine MOF structures, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. At the end of the term, students presented their work during a formal poster session where they received valuable feedback from faculty and graduate students at Oregon State University.

To provide a more comprehensive description of the behavior of the hydrocarbon molecules within the MOF-74 cavity, diffusion processes and corresponding diffusion barriers of small hydrocarbons in the MOF-74-Mg were modeled. This work provides a description of the molecular transport processes of CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 within and along the cavity of MOF-74-Mg; in addition, the influence of pre-adsorbed water molecules is also addressed. Density functional theory (DFT), as implemented within a plane-wave (PW) approach under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), has been used to investigate the diffusion mechanisms using the climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method, coupled with the van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) and ultra-soft pseudopotentials. Two transport mechanisms were identified: M1, referring to the molecular migrations within the MOF cavity; and M2, referring to the molecular migrations along the MOF longitudinal channel. The M1 transport mechanism was further analyzed to address the molecular migration from one metal atom to its adjacent one (M1a), and with respect to the second metal over (M1b). All the transport mechanisms considered show that the diffusion of paraffin molecules in MOF-74-Mg is energetically more favorable than that of olefin molecules. An interesting trend is observed across all the diffusion mechanisms where the stronger the molecule binds to the open metal site, the higher the diffusion barrier it needs to overcome. For all the small hydrocarbons considered in this study, transport mechanism M1a is significantly more energetically favorable than M1b, showing that it is easier for molecules to drift along the longitudinal cavity than to remain trapped cross-sectionally within the cavity itself. This work shows how this computational approach can be successfully applied not only to reveal the molecular transport in other MOF-74 isostructural species, but also in the fundamental understanding of the screening of MOFs and other nano-porous materials for gas separation applications.",0.9130265013769034,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-19 00:59:21.119142,False

With infinite structural possibilities, the MOF community is reliant on simulations to identify the most promising candidates for given applications. Among thousands of reported structures, many exhibit limited reproducibility - in either synthesis, performance, or both - owing to the sensitivity of synthetic conditions. Geometric distortions that may arise in the functional groups of pyrene-based ligands during synthesis and/or activation cannot easily be predicted. This sometimes leads to discrepancies between in-silico and experimental results.

Interestingly however, our study reveals that the choice of metal also affects the rotational freedom of the ligand's benzoate groups, impacting the overall predicted ranking of the MOFs based on their CO2 uptake.

Potential for Metal-Organic Frameworks","Machine-learned Potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling `quantum-accurate' potentials to linear time complexity. Yet, while they provide a more accurate reproduction of structural properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training dataset from \textit{ab initio} calculations. However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3,000 Zn-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations. More broadly, our contribution facilitates the development of general MLPs to accelerate chemical discoveries among other systems of interest at a fraction of the computational cost.

Understanding and predicting gas adsorption within porous materials demands comprehensive computational simulations that are often resource intensive, limiting the identification of promising materials. Active learning (AL) methods offer an effective strategy to reduce the computational burden by selectively acquiring critical data for model training. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit immense potential across various adsorption applications due to their porous structure and their modular nature, leading to diverse pore sizes and chemistry that serve as an ideal platform to develop adsorption models. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of AL in predicting gas adsorption within MOFs using “alchemical” molecules and their interactions as surrogates for real molecules. We first applied AL separately to each MOF, reducing the training dataset size by 57.5% while retaining predictive accuracy. Subsequently, we amalgamated the refined datasets across 1800 MOFs to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, successfully predicting adsorption of real molecules. Furthermore, by integrating MOF features into the AL framework using principal component analysis (PCA), we navigated MOF space effectively, achieving high predictive accuracy with only a subset of MOFs.

Classical density functional theory (cDFT) has recently been used as a faster alternative to state-of-the-art computational methods for screening of porous materials. However, extensive validation of cDFT predictions has not been performed for many materials, in a wide range of conditions, and with guest molecules exhibiting strong Coulombic interactions. In this paper, we validate the cDFT predictions by calculating the adsorption properties for more than 500 Metal-Organic Frameworks with three adsorbate molecules (CH4, N2, and CO2) and comparing them to state-of-the-art results from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. For CO2, we introduce the computation of Coulombic interactions between the MOF and the molecule, which are necessary to accurately describe this system.

Although metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied as adsorbents for CO2¬ and CH4, less effort has focused on the use of MOFs to remove N2O from emission streams or from air. Further, N2O activation would enable its use as an inexpensive oxidant for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we identify features that contribute to strong binding and high uptake of N2O at coorinatively unsaturated metal sites in the M2Cl2(btdd) (M= Mn, Co, Ni, Cu; btdd2– = bis(1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4′,5′-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) and M2(dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; dobdc4− = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) series of MOFs. Combined experimental and computational studies suggest that N2O adsorption at open-metal-sites is primarily based on electrostatic interactions, rather than π-backbonding, causing MOFs with more Lewis acidic metal centers to be superior N2O adsorbents. As a result, Mg2(dobdc) demonstrates strong binding and record-setting N2O uptake (8.75 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K). Using density functional theory (DFT) to characterize reactive intermediates and transition states, we demonstrate that N2O activation to form a M(IV)-oxo species and N2 is thermodynamically favorable in Mn2(dobdc) and Fe2(dobdc) but appears to be kinetically limited in Mn2(dobdc).

We introduce a calibration scheme for the U parameter, which is tailored for each MOF, by leveraging higher-level calculations on the secondary building unit (SBU) of the MOF. When applied to the full periodic MOF, the U parameter calibrated against hybrid HSE06 calculations of SBUs successfully reproduces hybrid-quality calculations of the adsorption energy of the periodic MOF. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) of adsorption energies reduces from 0.13 eV for a standard GGA treatment to 0.06 eV with the calibrated U, demonstrating the utility of the calibration procedure when applied to the full MOF structure. Furthermore, attempting to use CCSD(T) calculations of isolated SBUs for this calibration procedure shows varying degrees of success in predicting the experimental heat of adsorption. It improves accuracy for N2 adsorption for cases of overbinding, whereas its impact on CO2 is minimal, and ambiguities in spin state assignment hinder consistent improvements of O2 adsorption.

The resulting computational framework predicts MOF separations properties for various binary mixtures at various compositions and pressures. The accuracy of the MLP+IAST framework was sufficiently high so that, for a given separation, MOFs in the 90th percentile from MLP+IAST-based screening contain ~87% of MOFs in the 95th percentile one would obtain from molecular simulation-based screening.

For screening a large number of materials we also increasingly rely on isotherms predicted from molecular simulations. In particular, for such screening studies, it is important that the procedures to generate the data are accurate, reliable, and robust. In this work, we develop an efficient and automated workflow for a meticulous sampling of pure component isotherms. The workflow was tested on a set of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and proved to be reliable given different guest molecules. We show that the coupling of our workflow with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation saves CPU time, yet enables us to accurately predict pure component isotherms at the temperatures of interest, starting from a reference isotherm at a given temperature. We also show that one can accurately predict the CO2 and N2 mixture isotherms using Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST). In particular, we show that IAST is a more reliable numerical tool to predict binary adsorption uptakes for a range of pressures, temperatures, and compositions, as it does not rely on the fitting of experimental data, which typically needs to be done with analytical models such as dual-site Langmuir (DSL). This makes IAST a more suitable and general technique to bridge the gap between adsorption (raw) data and process modelling. To demonstrate this point, we show that the ranking of materials, for a standard 3-step Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) process, can be significantly different depending on the thermodynamic method used to predict binary adsorption data. We show that for the design of processes that capture CO2 from low concentration (0.4%) streams, the commonly used methodology to predict mixture isotherms incorrectly assigns up to 33% of the materials as top-performing.",0.9129312817554811,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanomaterials OR adsorption OR sorption),2024-11-19 01:03:05.257164,False

However, with millions of possible MOFs to be considered, it is challenging to identify the ideal MOF for the application of choice. Although computational screening of MOF databases has provided a fast way to evaluate MOF properties, validation experiments on predicted “exceptional” MOFs are not common due to uncertainties on the synthetic likelihood of computationally constructed MOFs, hence hindering material discovery. Aiming to leverage the perspective provided by large datasets, here we created and screened a topologically diverse database of 8,500 MOFs to interrogate whether thermodynamic stability metrics such as free energy could be used to generally predict the synthetic likelihood of computationally constructed MOFs. To this end, we first evaluated the suitability of two methods and three force fields to calculate free energies in MOFs at large scale, settling on the Frenkel-Ladd path thermodynamic integration method and the UFF4MOF force field. Upon defining a relative free energy, Δ<sub>LM</sub>F<sub>FL</sub>, that corrects for some force field artifacts specific to MOF nodes, we found that previously synthesized MOFs tended to cluster in a region below Δ<sub>LM</sub>F<sub>FL</sub> = 4.4 kJ/mol per atom, suggesting a general first filter to discriminate between synthetically likely and unlikely MOFs. However, a second filter is needed when several MOF isomorphs are below the Δ<sub>LM</sub>F<sub>FL</sub> threshold. In 84% of the cases, the synthetically accessible MOF within an isomorphic series presented the lowest predicted free energy. The present; work suggests that crystal free energies could be key to understanding synthetic likelihood for MOFs in computational databases (and MOFs in general), and that the thermodynamics stability of the fully assembled MOF often determines synthetic accessibility.",0.910009768004129,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR nanomaterials OR adsorption OR sorption),2024-11-19 01:03:07.018240,False

We investigate the oxidation of methane and the further potential oxidation of the product methanol using N₂O as an oxygen source and map the potential energy landscape of these reactions using density functional theory calculations. We show that the highest energy barrier encountered during the methane oxidation process is not the C-H bond breaking, but the activation of the iron center by N₂O. Furthermore, the potential energy landscape for the C-H bond activation exhibits a large, high-energy plateau region instead of a sharp transition state, thus differing from the traditional radical rebound mechanism.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in general domains, they still face significant challenges when applied to specialized problems in fields like materials science. In this study, we enhance the performance of LLMs in the specific field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage by employing a post-pretraining approach to customize the LLM with domain-specific learning. By incorporating a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 2,000 MOF structures, over 7,000 related scientific papers, and a corpus exceeding 210 million tokens of specialized materials and chemical knowledge, we developed a domain-specific LLM for MOFs, referred to as MOFs-LLM. Through supervised fine-tuning, we unlocked the potential of MOFs-LLM in various tasks, including performance prediction, inverse design, mechanistic studies and application prospect analysis, with a specific focus on hydrogen storage material design challenges. In the practical application of reverse design, we utilize MOFs-LLM to mutate numerous ligands and select suitable building blocks, resulting in a structural space encompassing more than 100,000 MOFs. A MOF structure with highly promising hydrogen storage performance was ultimately successfully identified.

Computational quantum chemical calculations can aid in this quest. To set the stage, we review general thermodynamic considerations that control the usable storage capacity of a sorbent. We then discuss cluster modeling of \ce{H2} ligation at MOF binding sites using state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and how the binding can be understood using energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Employing these tools, we illustrate the connections between the character of the MOF binding site and the associated adsorption thermodynamics using four experimentally characterized MOFs, highlighting the role of open metal sites (OMSs) in accessing binding strengths relevant to room temperature storage. The sorbents are MOF-5, with no open metal sites, \ce{Ni2}(\textit{m}-dobdc), containing Lewis acidic Ni(II) sites, Cu(I)-MFU-4\textit{l}, containing $\pi$ basic Cu(I) sites and V\textsubscript{2}Cl\textsubscript{2.8}(btdd), also containing $\pi$-basic V(II) sites.   We next explore the potential for binding multiple \ce{H2} molecules at a single metal site, with thermodynamics useful for storage at ambient temperature; a materials design goal which has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Computations on Ca$^{2+}$ or Mg$^{2+}$ bound to catecholate or Ca$^{2+}$ bound to porphyrin show the potential for binding up to 4 \ce{H2}; there is precedent for the inclusion of both catecholate and porphyrin motifs in MOFs. Turning to transition metals, we discuss the prediction that two \ce{H2} molecules can bind at V(II)-MFU-4\textit{l}, a material that has been synthesized with solvent coordinated to the V(II) site. Additional calculations demonstrate binding three equivalents of hydrogen per OMS in Sc(I) or Ti(I)-exchanged MFU-4\textit{l}. Overall, the results suggest promising prospects for experimentally realizing higher capacity hydrogen storage MOFs, if nontrivial synthetic and desolvation challenges can be overcome.

The resulting composite catalyst, tested in the reductive amination of levulinic acid, is found to have a markedly improved lifetime when compared to just the MOF or polymer support containing Pd. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the lifetime enhancement stems directly from the polymer, which plays a dual role: i) the oligomer stabilizes the MOF support through the elimination of certain vibrational modes associated with the framework ligand and likely pore-filling effects in the largest MOF pore, and ii) the Lewis base functionality on the oligomer backbone binds to the surface of the Pd NPs, thus, increasing their activity and inhibiting their aggregation.

Substrate transport rates in these materials can significantly influence the efficiency of such applications. Two factors that contribute to transport rates include 1) the porosity of the silicate matrix and
2) non-bonding interactions between the diffusing species and the silicate surface. These contributions generally emerge from disparate length scales, namely 'microscopic' (roughly nanometer-scale) and 'macroscopic' (roughly micron-scale), respectively. Here, we develop a simulation framework to estimate the simultaneous impact of these factors on methane mass transport in silicate channels.
Specifically, we develop a model of methane transport using homogenization theory to obtain transport parameters valid at length scales of hundreds to thousands of nanometers.
These parameters implicitly reflect interactions taking place at fractions of a nanometer. The inputs to the homogenization analysis are data from extensive molecular dynamics simulations that incorporate atomistic-scale interactions, processed to yield local diffusion coefficients and mean force potentials. With this model, we demonstrate how nuances in silicate hydration and silica/methane interactions impact methane diffusion rates in silicate materials, including the effects of silicate surface chemistry such as the presence of silanol groups.
The molecular dynamics simulations indicate that methane diffusivity at the silica surface is lower than the bulk-like rates observed at the center of channels of sufficient width.
However, potentials of mean force generally evidence attractive methane/silica interactions that enhance diffusion overall. By simultaneously accounting for both of these effects, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient for the nanoporous silicate can be approximately double the value of estimates assuming fully bulk-like behavior in the channel. This study therefore demonstrates the importance of determining diffusion coefficients and potentials of mean force at an atomistic level when estimating transport properties in bulk materials.
Importantly, we provide a simple homogenization framework to incorporate these molecular-scale attributes into bulk material transport estimates. This hybrid homogenization/molecular dynamics approach will be of general use for describing small molecule transport in materials with detailed molecular interactions.

In this paper, we propose a novel application of diffusion generative models for stabilizing reactive molecular structures identified through quantum mechanical screening. Specifically, we focus on the design challenge presented by Singlet Fission (SF), a phenomenon crucial for advancing solar cell efficiency beyond theoretical limits. While theoretical chemistry has been successful in predicting intermolecular arrangements with enhanced SF coupling, the practical implementation of these configurations faces challenges due to discrepancies between favorable and stabilized structures.

Stable metal-oxo species have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating the development of structure-property relationships. To overcome these challenges, we train the first machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting metal-oxo formation energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states. Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel ridge regression or artificial neural network ML models, we achieve good mean absolute errors (4-5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations. Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance of non-local, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing both expected trends in oxo formation energetics, such as destabilization of the metal-oxo species with increasing <i>d</i>-filling, as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity. We carry out uncertainty aware evolutionary optimization using the ANN to explore a > 37,000 candidate catalyst space. New metal and oxidation state combinations are uncovered and validated with density functional theory (DFT), including counter-intuitive oxo-formation energies for oxidatively stable complexes.

Here, we introduce tools that simplify data acquisition from density functional theory (DFT) and validation of trained machine learning models using the molSimplify automatic design (mAD) workflow. We demonstrate this workflow by training and comparing the performance of LASSO, kernel ridge regression (KRR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models using heuristic, topological revised autocorrelation (RAC) descriptors we have recently introduced for machine learning inorganic chemistry. On a series of open shell transition metal complexes, we evaluate set aside test errors of these models for predicting the HOMO level and HOMO-LUMO gap.

New theoretical approaches are needed to gauge the catalytic activity of high-entropy alloys and optimize the alloy composition within a feasible time frame as a prerequisite for further experimental studies.
Herein, we establish a workflow for simulations of catalysis on high-entropy alloy surfaces. For each step of the modeling we present our choice of method, however, we also acknowledge that alternative options are available.
We apply the developed methodology to predict the net catalytic activity of any alloy composition, within the composition space spanned by Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru, for the oxygen reduction reaction.

Subsequently, taking competitive co-adsorption of reaction intermediates into account, we couple the net adsorption energy distribution of a high-entropy alloy surface to the expected current density. Lastly, this procedure is used in conjunction with a Bayesian optimization scheme to search for optimal alloy compositions, which yields several promising compositions.

often modeled using polarizabilities and C<sub>n</sub> (n=6, 8, 9, 10 …)

be constructed using atom-in-material dispersion coefficients and
polarizabilities. This article addresses the key question of how to efficiently
assign these parameters to constituent atoms in a material so that properties
of the whole material are better reproduced. We develop a new set of scaling
laws and computational algorithms (called MCLF) to do this in an accurate and
computationally efficient manner across diverse material types. We introduce a
conduction limit upper bound and m-scaling to describe the different behaviors
of surface and buried atoms. We validate MCLF by comparing results to
high-level benchmarks for isolated neutral and charged atoms, diverse diatomic
molecules, various polyatomic molecules (e.g., polyacenes, fullerenes, and
small organic and inorganic molecules), and dense solids (including metallic,
covalent, and ionic). MCLF provides the non-directionally screened
polarizabilities required to construct force fields, the directionally-screened
static polarizability tensor components and eigenvalues, and environmentally
screened C<sub>6</sub> coefficients. Overall, MCLF has improved accuracy and
lower computational cost than the TS-SCS method. For TS-SCS, we compared charge
partitioning methods and show DDEC6 partitioning yields more accurate results
than Hirshfeld partitioning. MCLF also gives approximations for C<sub>8</sub>,
C<sub>9</sub>, and C<sub>10</sub> dispersion coefficients and Quantum Drude

Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are frequently employed in this domain, utilizing random mutations and crossovers steered by explicit mathematical objective formulations to navigate the search space. The transfer and sharing of knowledge across different GA optimization tasks, however, remain challenging. Here, we introduce the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) for TMCs. LLM- EO significantly outperforms traditional GAs due to the intrinsic chemical knowledge embedded within LLMs, acquired during their extensive pretraining. Notably, without the need for supervised fine-tuning, LLMs can leverage the entirety of historical data amassed during the optimization processes, demonstrating superior performance compared to LLMs that are limited to the best TMCs identified in the evolutionary cycle. Specifically, LLM-EO identifies eight out of the top 20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by interrogating merely 200 candidates within a vast search space of 1.37 million TMCs. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility in multi-objective optimizations, especially when guided by seasoned researchers, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations.
