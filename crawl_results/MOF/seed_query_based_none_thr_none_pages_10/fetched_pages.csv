However, the potential of AI to work backwards, towards predicting/designing a finetuned material for a given separation, remains untapped. Recent works report the inverse design of functionalized materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but they are limited to targeted sorption properties, while diffusivity, D, which is the driving force in membrane-based separations, is omitted. Herein, we report a tool combining a biologically inspired evolutionary algorithm with machine learning to design fine-tuned Zeolitic-Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-family of MOFs, for desired sets of diffusivities (Di, Di/Dj) values of any given mixture of species i and j. We moreover display the efficacy of our tool, by designing ZIFs that meet industrial performance criteria of permeability and selectivity, for CO2/CH4, O2/N2 and C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. We validate the designed ZIFs through appropriate simulations, confirming the suitability of the AI-suggested ZIF designs.",na,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 16:13:08.193487,False

The overwhelming majority of the studies is focused on propylene/propane separation. Nevertheless, as the ultimate goal is to obtain propylene as the end product, propylene-selective MOFs necessitate a demanding and complex desorption process, which consumes a substantial amount of energy and involves intricate operations. Consequently, having an adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs propane instead would be more advantageous. This approach would enable the production of high-purity propylene in a single step and lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and the quantity of adsorbent required. The Computation-Ready Experimental Metal-Organic Framework (CoRE MOF) 2019 database is utilized for the computational screening of flexible MOFs using molecular dynamics simulations to identify materials with strong potential for separating propane/propylene via self-diffusion. This screening process is the first to fully consider the impact of framework flexibility on the discovery of guest self-diffusion coefficients. The study underscores the significance of accounting for framework flexibility in investigations of gas molecules transport in MOFs, showcases the potential of using data-driven approaches to identify high-performance materials, and suggests methods for enhancing the predictive capabilities of screening workflows.  The top 5 MOFs from the CoRE MOF database for propane and propylene separation at a temperature of 298 K are identified. It is observed that the presence of carbonyl groups greatly enhances the separation properties between propane and propylene. Subsequently, a machine learning approach is utilized to develop a model and uncover important features. The machine learning model's predicted values for self-diffusion are reasonably consistent with the data obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.",na,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 16:13:08.411004,False

Building upon and extending the comparative analysis, our investigation underscores the CATBoost model's remarkable predictive prowess, characterized by a significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) and an enhanced R-squared (R²) value, thereby affirming its superior accuracy and reliability in forecasting CO2 adsorption. A pivotal aspect of our research is the integration of SHAP values for a detailed assessment of feature importance, which not only corroborated 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area' as pivotal determinants of CO2 uptake but also illuminated the model's advanced analytical capabilities in handling categorical features and mitigating overfitting, even within a dataset marked by intricate and non-linear patterns. Our quantitative and conceptual analysis, showcasing up to a 15% improvement in (RMSE) over previous models, reveals the CATBoost model’s unparalleled efficiency in discerning the multifaceted interplay of factors influencing CO2 adsorption. This is crucial for the strategic engineering of MOFs with optimized properties. Beyond 'Pressure' and 'Surface Area', our SHAP analysis highlighted other descriptors with substantial values, elucidating their nuanced contributions to CO2 uptake and providing invaluable insights for the MOF design process.

Owing to their high surface area, porosity, and tunability, MOFs have received significant attention for numerous applications such as gas separation and storage. Atomistic simulations and data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) have been successfully employed to screen large databases and successfully develop new experimentally synthesized and validated MOFs for CO2 capture. To enable data-driven materials discovery for any application, the first (and arguably most crucial) step is database curation. This work introduces the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC-MOF) database. This is a database of ~280,000 MOFs which have been either experimentally characterized or computationally generated, spanning all publicly available MOF databases. A key feature of ARC-MOF is that it contains DFT-derived electrostatic potential fitted partial atomic charges for each MOF. Additionally, ARC-MOF contains pre-computed descriptors for out-of-the-box machine learning applications. An in-depth analysis of the diversity of ARC-MOF with respect to the currently mapped design space of MOFs was performed – a critical, yet commonly overlooked aspect of previously reported MOF databases. Using this analysis, balanced subsets from ARC-MOF for various machine learning purposes have been identified.

The intrinsic length and time scales often stretch far beyond the nanometer and picosecond range due to e.g. large spatial heterogeneities or complex phase transitions. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can extend the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) towards such challenging systems,  but the generation of a representative training set of atomic configurations still poses a major challenge. In this work, we present an incremental learning scheme that constructs accurate and transferable MLPs based on a minimal number of DFT evaluations. Key to the approach is a combination of an active learning scheme that generates systematically improved MLPs with efficient and parallelized enhanced sampling protocols that explore increasingly larger portions of the phase space and learn physical interactions on-the-fly. The method requires a single atomic structure and a collective variable as input, after which the incremental learning approach constructs accurate interatomic potentials based on as few as 1000 single point DFT evaluations, even for flexible frameworks with multiple structurally different phases. The accuracy of the obtained potentials is extensively validated in terms of structural and mechanical properties across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, yielding thermodynamically transferable MLPs. Finally, it is demonstrated how the incremental learning approach shows great potential to train universal MLPs for a larger set of materials. A proof of principle based on 10 well-known aluminum- and zirconium-based MOFs is shown. The proposed incremental learning approach is universally applicable and may induce a paradigm shift in both the accuracy as well as the time and length scale of computational models for framework materials.",na,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 16:13:10.092389,False

In this study, we present a novel approach to further enhance the properties of porous polymer membranes emerging from MOFs through crosslinking of the organic linker molecules and subsequent metal-atom removal. To ensure reproducibility of the multi-step synthesis process and high quality of the resulting polymeric membranes, we automated the process and followed a machine learning optimization approach. The high-quality MOF-thin films (SURMOFs) were prepared in a layer-by-layer fashion directly on gold-coated porous alumina substrates. This direct synthesis proved crucial to preserve the structural integrity of the membranes and thus avoiding defect formation caused by a substrate-transfer process, which is usually required when advanced materials are used to fabricate a membrane. The initial SURMOF membrane exhibits moderate gas separation performance, once crosslinked, its gas selectivity could be significantly enhanced although with the compromise of lower gas permeance. Interestingly, once we removed the metal centers and thereby converted the SURMOF into a purely organic polymeric membrane, the membrane gas permeance could be restored almost to its initial condition while preserving the enhanced selectivities. In particular, the resulting polymeric membrane outperforms most commercially available polymer membranes for H2 /CO2 gas separation. This research outlines a promising approach to employ MOFs as template in the generation of advanced polymer membranes for various gas and liquid phase separation applications.",na,"""Machine Learning"" AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks)",2024-11-18 16:13:10.584126,False

The presence of open metal sites (OMS) significantly influences the catalytic, adsorption, and separation capabilities of MOFs. However, common laboratory methods are indirect and can suffer from structural heterogeneity. Computational methods, including machine learning, play a central role in the rational design of MOFs, yet in silico detection of OMS still relies heavily on computationally expensive simulations. In this work, we use extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) and random forest (RF) methods to predict the existence of OMS in various MOF compounds based on structural and chemical features. RF provided a higher prediction accuracy of 0.891 compared to 0.865 of XGBoost. Average ionization energy, average electron affinity, and fraction of electrons in d orbitals exhibited the highest importance scores across the two models. These prediction models not only provide novel insights into the structural-property relationship between MOFs and OMS, but also would enable accurate and efficient exploration of MOFs that would give rise to OMS, facilitating the engineering of sorption, separation, and catalytic properties.

MFMs have a wide variety of potential and realised adsorption applications. In order to design an ideal framework material for a particular application, the composition of molecular fragments is not the only factor, but the arrangement of the those fragments is also important, especially when the fragments (molecular building blocks) are chemically functionalised and lack symmetry. As has been observed in Metal Organic Frameworks, the flexibility and absorption properties may differ greatly when altering the orientation of the building units or changing the position of functional groups. However, although the position of functional group has a great influence on a targeted property, studies on functional group arrangements have only been performed on a small set of MOF structures.

In this contribution, we develop a fingerprint/descriptor for optimising functionalised molecular framework structures using machine learning. We begin from  the  perspective of a molecular framework structure described as a collection of discrete pore shapes. To describe the chemical environment of the pore, we derive a fingerprint based on the occurrence of pairwise distances between functional groups in each pore. We present the possibilities of functional group arrangements in the 14 most common pore shapes, created by ditopic (2-connected) linkers are presented.

Traditional simulation approaches, such as molecular dynamics, are complex and computationally demanding. Although feature engineering-based machine learning methods perform better, they are susceptible to overfitting because of limited labeled data. Furthermore, these methods are typically designed for single tasks, such as predicting gas adsorption capacity under specific conditions, which restricts the utilization of comprehensive datasets including all adsorption capacities. To address these challenges, we propose Uni-MOF, an innovative framework for large-scale, three-dimensional MOF representation learning, designed for universal multi-gas prediction. Specifically, Uni-MOF serves as a versatile ""gas adsorption detector"" for MOF materials, employing pure three-dimensional representations learned from over 631,000 collected MOF and COF structures. Our experimental results show that Uni-MOF can automatically extract structural representations and predict adsorption capacities under various operating conditions using a single model. For simulated data, Uni-MOF exhibits remarkably high predictive accuracy across all datasets. Impressively, the values predicted by Uni-MOF correspond with the outcomes of adsorption experiments.

In the present study, the modeling of quantities available for hundreds of MOFs is scaled up to many thousands of entities using supervised machine learning. The experimental dataset was curated to train multimodal transformer-based networks, which integrated crystal graph, energy-grid, and global-state embeddings. Uncertainty-aware models reveal superprotonic conductors among synthesized MOFs that have not been previously investigated for the considered application, highlighting magnesium-containing frameworks with aliphatic linkers as high-confidence candidates for experimental validation. Furthermore, classifiers trained on the activation energy threshold effectively discriminated between well-known proton-conduction mechanisms, providing physical insights beyond black-box routine.

However, the asymmetric development in the field of MOFs has led to data imbalance when it comes to MOFs versus other porous materials such as COFs, PPNs, and zeolites.

However, compared to other porous materials, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks, the successful integration of hierarchical porosity into COFs remains largely unexplored. The challenge lies in identifying appropriate synthetic methods to introduce secondary pores without compromising the intrinsic structural porosity of COFs. In this study, we realize a template-induced synthetic methodology to facilitate the construction of hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs). This novel approach utilizes commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as a hard template, enabling us to increase the total pore volume of a series of β-ketoenamine-linked COFs as well as an imine-based COF while preserving their surface areas. In addition to transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption analyses, small-angle X-ray scattering and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were employed to investigate the hierarchical porosity and diffusivity of guest molecules within hCOFs.

Quantifying the self-diffusion of guest molecules in the interior of their nanometer-sized pores allows for a better understanding of confinement effects or transport limitations and is thus vital for various applications ranging from molecular separation to catalysis. Using a combination of pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we have probed the self-diffusion of acetonitrile in the 1.7 nm diameter pore channels of two imine-linked COFs (PI-3-COF) featuring different levels of crystallinity and porosity, between 270 K and 300 K. In the sample showing higher crystallinity and porosity, we observe clear evidence for anisotropic diffusion parallel to the pore channel direction as characterized by a diffusion coefficient of D_par = 6.1 × 10^-10 m2/s at T = 300 K, consistent with 1D transport. Self-diffusion in the pores vs. bulk liquid is thus reduced by a factor of 7.4, in good agreement with MD simulations which predict a reduction of the self-diffusion coefficient by a factor of 5.4 compared to the bulk liquid value, assuming an offset-stacked COF layer arrangement. In contrast, more frequent diffusion barriers give rise to isotropic, yet significantly reduced diffusivities in the low-porosity sample (D_B = 1.4 × 10^-11 m2/s at T = 300 K).

They are  intriguing platforms for the design of porous skeletons with special functionality at the molecular level. However, despite their extraordinary properties, it is difficult to control their electronic properties, thus hindering the potential implementation in electronic devices. A new form of nanoporous material, COFs intercalated with first row transition metal is proposed to address this fundamental drawback - the lack of electronic tunability. Using first-principles calculations, we have designed 31 new COF materials <i>in-silico</i> by intercalating all of the first row transition metals (TMs) with boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs: COF-TM-x (where TM=Sc-Zn and x=3-5). This is a significant addition considering that only 187 experimentally COFs structures has been reported and characterized so far. We have investigated their structure and electronic properties. Specifically, we predict that COF's band gap and density of states (DOSs) can be controlled by intercalating first row transition metal atoms (TM: Sc - Zn) and fine tuned by the concentration of TMs. We also found that the $d$-subshell electron density of the TMs plays the main role in determining the electronic properties of the COFs. Thus intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to control the electronic properties of materials within a porous network.

This mechanism is also reversible and involves faster kinetics than chemical storage. Materials with certain structural and porous properties are necessary for volumetrically efficient hydrogen storage, including large specific surface areas, pore volumes, and appropriated bulk densities. Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) materials are remarkable candidates as adsorbents due to their porous properties and high crystallinity. Large databases like the MOF subset from the CSD or the CoRE-MOF can be used to find the best materials for this application, providing crystallographic information, composition, and porous properties. Herein, we created a database which includes crystallographic and porous properties, metallic and organic composition, and the minimum available cost for their linkers and corresponding suppliers for those for which it was publicly available. The database is also helpful for selecting structures with potential for industrial production and starting material for computational tools like machine learning or artificial intelligence approaches that relate the composition of MOFs with their performance in different applications. A user interface allows for creating customized selections of suitable MOF structures, looking for their porous and crystalline properties, gravimetric and volumetric total uptakes, and metallic and organic composition, as well as properties for the organic linkers like name, molecular mass, price, or presence of specific functional groups.

They are well known for their porosity, large surface area, and related properties. The electronic properties of most MOFs and COFs are the superposition of those of their constituting building blocks. If crystalline, however, solid-state phenomena can be observed, such as electrical conductivity, substantial dispersion of electronic bands, broadened absorption bands, formation of excimer states, mobile charge carriers, and indirect band gaps. These effects emerge often by the proximity effect caused by the van-der-Waals interactions between stacked aromatic building blocks. This Progress Report shows how functionality is imposed by this proximity effect, that is, by stacking aromatic molecules in such a way that extraordinary electronic and optoelectronic properties emerge in MOFs and COFs. After discussing the proximity effect in graphene-related materials, its importance for layered COFs and MOFs is shown. For MOFs with well-defined structure, the stacks of aromatic building blocks can be controlled via varying MOF topology, lattice constant, and by attaching steric control units.

But in many cases, it impedes the mass transfer and diffusion of precursors toward noble metal NCs, thus resulting in suboptimal catalytic performance and inefficient use of the noble metal catalysts. Integration of noble metal NCs in a hollow MOF shell could address this concern. Herein, by using ZIF-67 as self-sacrificial template, we reported a simple strategy for synthesizing Pd@Hollow ZIF-67. Pre-formed Pd NCs are uniformly confined within a hollow ZIF-67 shell through the dissolution of the interior of a ZIF-67 sacrificial template and re-growth of a new ZIF-67 shell due to the competitive coordination of chloride ligands to cobalt ions in ethanol. This method can be easily extended to fabricate other hollow hybrid materials including Au@Hollow ZIF-67, Pt@Hollow ZIF-67 and sandwich Pd@Hollow ZIF-67.

However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures.

After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations.

Ranging from behavior indicative of large, Type V uptakes occurring at low relative pressure, to Type III equilibrium where little water is adsorbed, this phenomenon provides a challenge for a priori prediction. In an effort to elucidate adsorption mechanisms, this study advances a quantitative description of hydrophobicity through novel application of Ising model analysis (IMA). It is applied to scrutinize hydrophobicity indicated by Type III adsorption and displayed by micropores that are too large to induce a Type V water adsorption equilibrium.  Two types of hydrophobicity are identified and partitioned into surface and structural hydrophobicity, with quantitative assessment delivered by analysis of a data set covering 26 materials. Application of a modified Kelvin analysis (MKA) indicates that bulk water properties and macroscopic contact angles can characterize the equilibrium behavior of water in molecular level micropores of nanostructured MOF materials. Additionally, the concepts of nanocapillarity and nanowetting are established and prove capable of further characterizing the hydrophobicity of these materials. Finally, the methods and analyses applied to these phenomena in MOF micropores could foreseeably aid in screening studies, be used to assess the presence of cooperative, wetting, and condensation-like mechanisms and be further employed to estimate contact angles and scrutinize phenomena associated with hydrophobicity in other microporous, nanostructured materials.

We provided a set of equations with different fidelities for on-demand predictions based on the accessibility of crystallographic features. We found that an equation with only three crystallographic primary features, as variables, can predict deliverable capacities of 84,800 COFs with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 10 cm<sup>3</sup> (standard temperature and pressure, STP) cm<sup>-3</sup> and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5%. However, the highest fidelity equation developed here contains seven crystallographic primary features of COFs with RMSE and MAPE of 8.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) cm<sup>-3</sup> and 4.2%, respectively. With that, we predicted methane storage capacities of 468,343 previously unexplored COFs using the highest fidelity equation and identified several hundred promising candidates with record-setting performance. CUBE_PBB_BA2, a hypothetical COF not yet synthesized, sets the new record of balancing gravimetric (0.396 g g-1) and volumetric (221 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) cm<sup>-3</sup>) deliverable methane storage capacities under the pressure swing between 65 and 5.8 bar at 298K.

Their inherently low mechanical stability, however, frequently renders existing methods of pelletisation ineffective contributing to pore collapse, pore blockage or insufficient densification of crystallites. Here, we present a general process for the shaping and densifying of COFs into centimetre-scale porous monolithic pellets without the need for templates, additives or binders. This process minimises mechanical damage from shear-induced plastic deformation and further provides a network of interparticle mesopores that we exploit in accessing analyte capacities above those achievable from the intrinsic porosity of the COF framework. Using a lattice-gas model, we accurately capture the monolithic structure across the mesoporous range and tie pore architecture to performance characteristics in both gas storage and separation applications.

However, a broad validation of molecular simulations in these materials is hampered by the lack of a connection between databases of gas adsorption experiments and databases of the atomic crystal structure of corresponding materials.
This work aims to connect the gas adsorption isotherms of metal-organic frameworks collected in the NIST/ARPA-E Database of Novel and Emerging Adsorbent Materials to a corresponding crystal structure in the Cambridge Structural Database. 
With tens of thousands of isotherms and crystal structures reported to date, an automatic approach is needed to establish this link, which we describe in this paper. 
As a first application and consistency check, we compare the pore volume deduced from low-temperature argon or nitrogen isotherms to the geometrical pore volume computed from the crystal structure. 
Overall, 545 argon or nitrogen isotherms could be matched to a corresponding crystal structure.

crystalline, highly porous materials attractive for applications such as gas
storage, gas separations, catalysis, contaminant adsorption and membrane
filtration. Activation of COFs removes adsorbed solvents and impurities, but
common methods for COF activation can result in collapse of porous structure
and loss of accessible surface areas. Here, we present a study of the impact of
solvent surface tension on the activation process and demonstrate that
activation using the ultralow surface tension solvent perfluorohexane (PFH) is
simple and effective for a range of COF materials. We synthesized six different
imine-based COFs through imine condensation reactions between tris(4-aminophenyl)
benzene (TAPB) or 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TAPT) and
multi-functional di- and tri-benzaldehydes with different aromatic
substituents. For each COF, we performed a solvent wash followed by vacuum
drying using six solvents varying in surface tension from 11.9 – 72.8 mN m<sup>-1</sup>.
Through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements combined with nitrogen
adsorption and desorption analysis, we found that some COF chemistries readily
lost their porosity during activation with higher surface tension solvents

using PFH to produce materials with excellent crystallinity and high surface
areas, comparable to those for samples activated using supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>.

To meet the Department of Energy's ambitious goals of achieving 50 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric and 6.5 wt \% gravimetric uptake targets, materials-based approaches are essential. Designing materials that can efficiently store hydrogen gas requires careful tuning of the interactions between the gaseous \ce{H2} and the surface of the material. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials due to their exceptionally high surface areas and tunable structures that can improve gas-framework interactions. However, weak binding enthalpies have limited the success of many current candidates, which fail to achieve even 10 g L$^{-1}$ volumetric uptake at ambient temperatures. To overcome this challenge, We utilized quantum mechanical (QM) based force fields (FF) to investigate the uptake and binding enthalpies of 3 linkers chelated with 7 different transition metals (TM), including both precious metals (Pd and Pt) and first row TM (Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn), to design 24 different COFs in-silico. By applying QM-based FF with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) from 0-700 bar and 298 K, We demonstrated that Co-, Ni-, Mn-, Fe-, Pd-, and Pt-based MSUCOFs can already achieve the Department of Energy's hydrogen storage targets for 2025. Surprisingly, the COFs that incorporated the more affordable and abundant first-row TM often outperformed the precious metals.

While machine learning (ML) has been leveraged to aid the design or screen of MOFs for different purposes, the needs of big data are not always met, limiting the applicability of ML models trained against small data sets. In this work, we introduce a transfer learning technique to improve the accuracy and applicability of ML models trained with small amount of MOF adsorption data. This technique leverages potentially shareable knowledge from a source task to improve the models on the target tasks. As demonstrations, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data with 13,506 MOF structures at 100 bar and 243 K is used as the source task. When transferring knowledge from the source task to H<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 100 bar and 130 K (one target task), the predictive accuracy on target task was improved from 0.960 (direct training) to 0.991 (transfer learning). We also tested transfer learning across different gas species (i.e. from H<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>), with predictive accuracy of CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption being improved from 0.935 (direct training) to 0.980 (transfer learning). Based on further analysis, transfer learning will always work on the target tasks with low generalizability.

Here we explore two structurally analogous 2D COFs with different polymerization chemistries using in operando X-ray diffraction, which demonstrates the loss of crystallinity at lower temperatures than the degradation temperatures measured by TGA. Density functional theory calculations suggest that an asymmetric buckling of the COF lattice is responsible for the observed loss of crystallinity.

Given an adsorption task, we often wish to search a library of NPMs for the one with the optimal adsorption property. The high cost of NPM synthesis and gas adsorption measurements, whether these experiments are in the lab or in a simulation, often precludes exhaustive search.

We explain, demonstrate, and advocate Bayesian optimization (BO) to actively search for the optimal NPM in a library of NPMs-- and find it using the fewest experiments. The two ingredients of BO are a surrogate model and an acquisition function. The surrogate model is a probabilistic model reflecting our beliefs about the NPM-structure--property relationship based on observations from past experiments. The acquisition function uses the surrogate model to score each NPM according to the utility of picking it for the next experiment. It balances two competing goals: (a) exploitation of our current approximation of the structure-property relationship to pick the highest-performing NPM, and (b) exploration of blind spots in the NPM space to pick an NPM we are uncertain about, to improve our approximation of the structure-property relationship. We demonstrate BO by searching an open database of ~70,000 hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the COF with the highest simulated methane deliverable capacity. BO finds the optimal COF and acquires 30% of the top 100 highest-ranked COFs after evaluating only ~120 COFs.

The performance and suitability of nanoporous materials for each specific application are directly related to both its physical and chemical properties, and their determination is crucial for process engineering and optimization of performances. In this Account, we focus on some recent developments in the multi-scale modeling of physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, highlighting the latest advances in three specific areas: mechanical properties, thermal properties, and adsorption. For the study of the mechanical behavior of nanoporous materials, the last few years have seen a rapid acceleration of research. For example, computational resources have been pooled to created public large-scale databases of elastic constants: those can serve as a basis for data-based discovery of materials with targeted properties, as well as the training of machine learning predictor models. The large-scale prediction of thermal behavior, in comparison, is not yet routinely performed at such large scale. Tentative databases have been assembled at the DFT level on specific families of materials, like zeolites, but prediction at larger scale currently requires the use of transferable, classical force fields, whose accuracy can be limited. Finally, adsorption is naturally one of the most studied physical properties of nanoporous frameworks, as fluid separation or storage is often the primary target for these materials. We highlight the recent achievements and open challenges for adsorption prediction at large scale, focusing in particular on the accuracy of computational models and the reliability of comparisons with experimental data available.

To aid discovery of porous molecular crystals for desired applications, energy-structure-function (ESF) maps were developed that combine a priori prediction of both the crystal structure and its functional properties. However, it is a challenge to represent the high-dimensional structural and functional landscapes of an ESF map and to identify energetically favourable and functionally interesting polymorphs among the 1,000s-10,000s of structures typically on a single ESF map. Here, we introduce geometric landscapes, a representation for ESF maps based on geometric similarity, quantified by persistent homology. We show that this representation allows the exploration of complex ESF maps, automatically pinpointing interesting crystalline phases available to the molecule. Furthermore, we show that geometric landscapes can serve as an accountable descriptor for porous materials to predict their performance for gas adsorption applications.

Sorption processes are typically modeled by means of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. However, GCMC methods are limited to physisorption processes described by molecular-mechanics, or, classical, interatomic potentials. Therefore, a computationally efficient GCMC method that accounts for chemisorption is needed. Here, we report hybrid interatomic potentials that are specifically designed for GCMC simulations of chemisorption. Namely, the sorbate-sorbate interaction is described by classical potentials and the sorbate-sorbent interaction is rendered by a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on simulation data extracted from quantum calculations. To prove the principal, we have applied the method to the simulation of \ce{CO2} chemisorption in the porous metal-organic framework Mg-MOF-74. By comparing the GCMC simulated \ce{CO2} adsorption isotherms and isobars, respectively, with the experimental data, we obtain better agreement compared to other classical and quantum-chemical simulation methods while keeping computational cost at a minimum.

					<p>In nanoporous materials, guest–host interactions affect the properties and function of
both adsorbent and adsorbate molecules. Due to their structural and chemical diversity, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a common class of nanoporous materials, have
been shown to be able to efficiently and, often, selectively adsorb various types of guest
molecules. In this study, we characterize the structure and dynamics of water confined
in ZIF-90. Through the integration of experimental and computational infrared (IR)  spectroscopy, we probe the structure of heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) adsorbed in the pores,
disentangling the fundamental framework–water and water–water interactions. The experimental IR spectrum of D<sub>2</sub>O in ZIF-90 displays a blue-shifted OD-stretch band
compared to liquid D<sub>2</sub>O. The analysis of the IR spectra simulated at both classical
and quantum levels indicates that the D<sub>2</sub>O molecules preferentially interact with the
carbonyl groups of the framework and highlights the importance of including nuclear
quantum effects and taking into account Fermi resonances for a correct interpretation
of the OD-stretch band in terms of the underlying hydrogen-bonding motifs. Through
a systematic comparison with the experimental spectra, we demonstrate that computational spectroscopy can be used to gain quantitative, molecular-level insights into
framework–water interactions that determine the water adsorption capacity of MOFs
as well as the spatial arrangements of the water molecules inside the MOF pores which,
in turn, are key to the design of MOF-based materials for water harvesting.</p>

Tailoring Sol-gel Ceramic Mesoporous Coatings on Labile Metal-organic Frameworks through Kinetic Control.,"Surface engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a mesoporous silica coating can improve MOF mechanical properties and provide an easy way to decorate MOF nanoparticles with organic or biological molecules though silane chemistry or electrostatic interactions, while retaining open access to MOF porosity. Silica coating would be highly beneficial for employing MOFs in a wide range of applications such as catalysis or drug delivery. However, obtaining a stable, controlled core-shell structure using MOF nanoparticles as seed is challenging because of their intrinsic chemically labile nature. Here we analyze the factors that destabilize the core of the Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) MOFs during the sol-gel deposition of a mesoporous silica shell causing a partial or total etching of the MOF material. Silicates in solution are found to scavenge Zn2+ ions removing them from the ZIF structure and causing a partial or complete dissolution of the ZIF seed. By carefully tuning the silicate concentration in solution simultaneous control can be obtained over both the ZIF-8 dissolution and the silica condensation kinetics, resulting in the growth of a uniform mesoporous silica shell while preserving the integrity of ZIF-8. The core-shell nanoparticles obtained show a compact core shell structure with no gap between the MOF core and the silica shell, even after calcination, while the crystalline ZIF-8 structure is retained. Overall, a general synthetic approach is presented for producing nanocomposite core-shell materials which can be applied to other MOF labile seed to design new hierarchical materials.",na,"Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"" OR porous materials OR crystalline frameworks OR supramolecular structures OR adsorption OR gas storage)",2024-11-18 16:18:42.478652,False

Herein, we introduce an approach to understanding structural modulation and deformation of soft, porous crystals in the context of gas adsorption by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation and physisorption analysis. Modified nanocrystals of the prototypical zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were generated in triethylamine (Et3N) via an in-situ supramolecular modulation method. We demonstrate that using triethylamine as a modulator results in a conspicuous decrease in elastic modulus (0.7 ± 0.2 GPa) compared to the unmodified nanocrystals of ZIF-8 (2.1 ± 0.8 GPa). Argon gas adsorption analysis also reveals that the more flexible, amine-modified framework exhibited gradual and cooperative gate-opening structural transitions (P/P0 = 0.33 ± 0.02) compared to the steep and stepwise characteristics of unmodified samples of ZIF-8 (P/P0 = 0.45 ± 0.02). The differences in Argon gas pressure-induced structural deformations correspond to the decrease in elastic modulus of base-modified nanocrystals of ZIF-8, likely a consequence of the impact of Et3N on the relative number of point defects and hydrogen bonds in the framework. Our study demonstrates how a combination of AFM nanoindentation, gas uptake, and spectroscopic characterization can be applied to understand structural and energetic changes upon adsorption in flexible framework materials.",na,"Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"" OR porous materials OR crystalline frameworks OR supramolecular structures OR adsorption OR gas storage)",2024-11-18 16:18:43.417863,False

been emerging as a new class of materials, which combine the functional 
properties of crystalline MOFs with the processability of glasses. 
However, only a handful of the vast variety of crystalline MOFs have 
been identified as being meltable. Porosity and metal-linker interaction
 strength have both been identified as crucial parameters in the 
trade-off between thermal decomposition of the organic linker and, more 
desirably, melting. For example, the inability of the prototypical 
zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) ZIF-8 to melt, is ascribed to the 
instability of the organic linker upon dissociation from the metal 
center. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of an ionic liquid 
(IL) into the porous interior of ZIF-8 provides a means to reduce its 
melting temperature to below its thermal decomposition temperature (Tm 
< Td). Experimental evidence shows that the Tm of ZIF-8 obtained by 
IL infiltration is around 381 °C, and that the glass forming ability 
(Tg/Tm) of such melts is above 0.9, i.e. higher than those previously 
reported for other meltable MOFs. Our structural studies show that the 
prevention of decomposition, and successful melting, is due to the IL 
interactions stabilizing the rapidly dissociating ZIF-8 linkers upon 
heating. This understanding may act as a general guide for extending the

Molecular crystal engineering is generally incapable of producing precisely spaced arrays of molecules for use in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and sensors. A promising alternative strategy is the incorporation of chromophores into crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to matrix coordination-induced emission (MCIE) upon confinement. However, it remains unclear how the precise arrangement of chromophores and defects dictates photophysical properties in these systems, limiting the rational design of well-defined photoluminescent materials. Herein, we report new, robust Zr-based MOFs constructed from the linker tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)ethylene (TCPE4−) that exhibit an unexpected structural transition in combination with a prominent shift from green to blue photoluminescence (PL) as a function of the amount of acid modulator (benzoic, formic, or acetic acid) used during synthesis. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements provide full spectral information and reveal that the observed hypsochromic shift arises due to a higher concentration of linker substitution defects at higher modulator concentrations, leading to broader excitation transfer-induced spectral diffusion. Spectral diffusion of this type has not been reported in a MOF to date, and its observation provides structural information that is otherwise unobtainable using traditional crystallographic techniques.

common perception of MOF structures being static. Structural dynamics in MOFs, however,
typically refers to the “breathing” behavior of pore cavities and the transient binding of guest
molecules, but dynamic bonding would explain important MOF phenomena in catalysis, post-
synthetic exchange, negative thermal expansion, and crystal growth. Here, we demonstrate through
use of variable-temperature diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (VT-
DRIFTS) aided by ab initio plane wave density function theory, that similar evidence for melting
behavior in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be observed for carboxylate MOFs by
monitoring the red-shifts of carboxylate stretches coupled to anharmonic metal-carboxylate
oscillators. To demonstrate the generality of these findings, we investigate a wide class of
carboxylate MOFs that includes iconic examples with diverse structures and metal-linker
chemistry. As the very vibrations invoked in ZIF melting, but heretofore unobserved for
carboxylate MOFs, these metal-linker dynamics resemble the ubiquitous soft modes that trigger
important phase transitions in diverse classes of materials, while offering a fundamentally new

We have developed a combined vibrational and visible spectroscopic setup to simultaneously monitor the adsorption of CO2 into porphyrinic Zr-MOFs, namely PCN-222 and PCN-223, and the photophysical changes in the porphyrin linker as function of water concentration. Computational simulations further corroborate the experimentally obtained adsorption enthalpies. We found a shift of CO2 sorption site from the Zr-cluster to the center of the porphyrin macrocycle when PCN-MOFs were brought in contact with humidity greater than the water pore condensation concentration. The shift in sorption site was accompanied by a bending of the porphyrin macrocycle, which induced a change in color and, thus, a change in spectral overlap with light. Furthermore, CO2/H2O competition experiments revealed that the exchange of CO2 by H2O is pore-size-dependent. Therefore, both humidity and pore-size allow to tune the CO2 sorption site, CO2 capacity, and light harvesting in porphyrinic MOFs, which are key factors for CO2 photoreduction.",na,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR adsorption OR desorption)),2024-11-18 16:19:27.589016,False

One of the most recent concerns is related to the pollution that comes from various pharmaceuticals, in particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) since they have been industrially produced at large scale and can be easily purchased as an over-the-counter medicine. Diclofenac is one of the most popular NSAIDs because of its high-effectiveness, which leads to its excessive consumption. Consequently, its presence in the water bodies is also continuously increasing. Adsorption process could then be employed as a highly effective method to address this issue. In comparison to other conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as an alternative adsorbent is very attractive since it can offer various advantages such as tailorability and high adsorption capacity. In this study, the performance of three water-stable, free-base porphyrin MOFs assembled using zirconia-based nodes, namely MOF-525, MOF-545, and NU-902, for diclofenac adsorption was thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, although all the three free-base porphyrin MOFs are assembled using the same building block and have a similar specific surface area (based on the experimental argon physisorption and calculation based on non-localized density functional theory), their diclofenac adsorption capacity is substantially different from one another. It is found that the highest diclofenac adsorption capacity is shown by MOF-525, which has maximum capacity around 792 mg g-1. This is then followed by MOF-545 and NU-902 that has adsorption capacity around 591 and 486 mg g-1, respectively. Some possible adsorption mechanisms are then thoroughly discussed that might contribute to this phenomenon. Lastly, their performance is also compared with other MOFs that are also studied for this purpose to show their performance superiority not only in terms of adsorption capacity but also their affinity towards diclofenac molecule.

To this, we introduce a novel linker design strategy featuring bulky functional groups, enforcing the preferred kgm structure, while hindering sql network formation. Implementing this design, we synthesized a terphenyl core-based tetraaldehyde linker (4A2E) incorporating a bulky methoxycarbonyl-terminated phenyl group. By varying the diamine linker lengths, using phenylenediamine (PDA) and benzidine (Bz), the steric interaction was tuned leading to the formation of different topologies. Structural analysis revealed the formation of a kgm network formation with an unusual ABC stacking for the 4A2E-PDA-COF with the short PDA linker, in contrast to the sql network in 4A2E-Bz-COF with the longer benzidine.

Twenty-two different amorphous MOF colloids were successfully synthesized by selecting 11 metal ions and 17 organic ligands. Moreover, by introducing pre-formed core-nanoparticles (NPs), a conformal and homogeneous amorphous MOFs coating with controllable thickness can be grown on core-NPs to form core-shell colloids.

The material undergoes a structural transition from an “open pore” phase to a contracted “closed pore” phase upon gas adsorption, leading to macroscopic gas desorption visible to the naked eye. It was initially evidenced experimentally in 2016 for the adsorption of methane and n-butane in the DUT-49 metal–organic framework (DUT = Dresden University of Technology), and later demonstrated to be a general phenomenon, occurring for different gases and in a variety of materials with the same topology. NGA materials belong to the category of metamaterials, displaying behavior that is not found (or rarely observed) in “natural” or simple materials. The negative adsorption transition takes place outside of thermodynamic equilibrium, and its characterization requires the use of many complementary experimental techniques (adsorption measurements, in situ X-ray diffraction, EXAFS, NMR, etc.), as well as molecular simulation techniques. In order to obtain a full and consistent picture of the NGA phenomenon, it is indeed necessary to combine computational modelling with a variety of methods, at different scales, in order to understand the microscopic behavior of the host framework and guest molecules to the macroscopic experimental results. At the smallest scale, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to understand the energetics and structure of the NGA materials, as well as the micromechanical properties of their organic linkers: the buckling of these linkers explains the large metastability of the open-pore phase, and gives rise to the NGA transition. At a larger scale, classical grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations in the “rigid host” structures can predict the adsorption capacity of different phases, elucidating the driving force behind the structural transition. To explicitly couple the flexibility of the framework and the adsorption of guest molecules, molecular dynamics simulations (relying on a classical force field for the flexible MOF) can be coupled with free energy methods to investigate the thermodynamics of NGA, obtaining free energy profiles that determine the relative stability of different phases with varying amounts of adsorbed gas. Finally, mesoscopic-scale modeling methods are required in order to understand the phenomenon at a scale larger than one unit cell, and explain experimental findings about the influence of crystal size effects on the NGA transition.

In these materials, the structural differences of the ligands used in the synthesis are sufficiently subtle that they can each occupy the same site in the framework. However, multivariate or ligand scrambling approaches are rarely used in the synthesis of porous metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) – the molecular equivalent of MOFs – despite the potential to retain a unique intrinsic pore from the individual cage while varying the extrinsic porosity of the material. Herein we directly synthesise scrambled cages across two families of lantern-type MOPs and find contrasting effects on their gas sorption properties. In one family, the scrambling approach sees a gradual increase in the BET surface area with the maximum and minimum uptakes associated with the two pure homoleptic cages. In the other, the scrambled materials display improved surface areas with respect to both of the original, homoleptic cages. Through analysis of the gas sorption isotherms, we attribute this effect to the balance of micro- and mesoporosity with the materials. The gas uptake of the materials presented here underscores the tunability of cages that springs from their combination of intrinsic, extrinsic, micro- and meso- porosities.",na,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR adsorption OR desorption OR gas sorption OR crystalline framework structures OR supramolecular architectures),2024-11-18 16:21:19.896172,False

by porous metal-organic framework scintillating nanocrystals.","Natural radioactive gases and anthropogenic radionuclides such as radon, xenon, hydrogen and krypton isotopes, need to be carefully monitored to be properly managed as pathogenic agents, radioactive diagnostic agents or indicators of nuclear activity. State-of-the-art gas detectors based on liquid scintillators suffer from many drawbacks such as lengthy sample preparation procedures and limited solubility of gaseous radionuclides, which produces a detrimental effect on measurement sensitivity. A potential breakthrough solution to this problem is using solid porous scintillators that act as gas concentrators and, therefore, could increase detection sensitivity. Highly porous scintillating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) stand out as relevant materials for the realization of these devices. We demonstrate the capability of porous hafnium-based MOF nanocrystals exploiting dicarboxy-9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) as a scintillating conjugated ligand to detect gas radionuclides. The nanocrystals show fast scintillation properties in the nanosecond domain, a fluorescence quantum yield of ~40% and an accessible porosity suitable to host noble gas atoms and ions. The adsorption and detection of radionuclides such as 85Kr, 222Rn and 3H have been explored for these MOFs utilising a newly developed device based on a time coincidence technique. MOF nanocrystals demonstrate an improved sensitivity for these radionuclides compared to a reference detector, showing an excellent linear response down to an activity value lower than 1 kBq·m-3 that outperforms commercial devices.

Using ZIF-7 as a benchmark, we reexamine the poorly understood structural transition responsible for its adsorption steps and, through high-pressure adsorption measurements, verify that it displays a step in its CH<sub>4 </sub>adsorption isotherms. The ZIF-9 material is shown to undergo an analogous phase change, yielding adsorption steps for CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> with similar profiles and capacities to ZIF-7, but with shifted threshold pressures. Further, the Cd<sup>2+</sup> analogue CdIF-13 is reported here for the first time, and shown to display adsorption behavior distinct from both ZIF-7 and ZIF-9, with negligible pre-step adsorption, a ~50% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> capacity, and dramatically higher threshold adsorption pressures. Remarkably, a single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase change to a pore-gated phase is also achieved with CdIF-13, providing insight into the phase change that yields step-shaped adsorption in these flexible ZIFs.

To predict the Xe/Kr selectivity of a COF structure, we have access to two molecular simulation techniques: (1) a higher-fidelity, binary grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation and (2) a lower-fidelity Henry coefficient calculation that (a) approximates the adsorbed phase as dilute and, consequently, (b) incurs a smaller computational runtime than the higher-fidelity simulation.

To efficiently search for the COF with the largest high-fidelity Xe/Kr selectivity, we employ a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) approach. MFBO constitutes a sequential, automated feedback loop of (1) conduct a low- or high-fidelity molecular simulation of Xe/Kr adsorption in a COF, (2) use the simulation data gathered thus far to train a surrogate model that cheaply predicts, with quantified uncertainty, the low- and high-fidelity simulated Xe/Kr selectivity of COFs from their structural/chemical features, and then (3) plan the next simulation (i.e., choose the next COF and fidelity) in consideration of balancing exploration, exploitation, and cost.

optoelectronic applications, such as long exciton lifetime and high directional exciton mobility. Framework materials, such as twodimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), as well as their truncated macrocyclic analogues, are versatile platforms to organize functional aromatic systems into designed assemblies and robust materials. Here we investigate the exciton dynamics in a 2D COF, its corresponding hexagonal macrocycle, and extended nanotubes comprised of stacked macrocycles. The excitonic behavior of these three systems provide an understanding of excitonic processes that occur in the plane of the covalently bonded 2D macromolecules and between layers of the nanotubes and 2D COF. The nanotube and analogous 2D COF exhibit longer excited-state
lifetimes (~100 ps) compared to the individual, solvated macrocycles (<0.5 ps). These differences are attributed to the internal conversion facilitated by the internal motions of the imine linkages which are significantly reduced in the assembled macrocycles in the nanotube and 2D COF sheets in the layered structures. The exciton diffusion processes in the assembled nanotubes and 2D COF
systems were characterized by the autocorrelations of the transition dipole moment of the excitons, giving the depolarization time constants for both systems to be ~1 ps. This work also reveals the anisotropic exciton dynamics related to the in-plane and inter-plane structural factors in these systems. These studies provide guidance for the design of future COF materials, where the longer excited
state lifetimes imparted by assembly are beneficial for optoelectronic applications.

In molecular simulations of gas adsorption/diffusion in MOFs, the adsorbate-MOF electrostatic interaction is typically modeled by placing partial point charges on the atoms of the MOF. For the virtual screening of large libraries of MOFs, it is critical to develop computationally inexpensive methods to assign atomic partial charges to MOFs that accurately reproduce the electrostatic potential in their pores. Herein, we design and train a message passing neural network (MPNN) to predict the atomic partial charges on MOFs under a charge neutral constraint. A set of ca. 2,250 MOFs labeled with high-fidelity partial charges, derived from periodic electronic structure calculations, serves as training examples. In an end-to-end manner, from charge-labeled crystal graphs representing MOFs, our MPNN machine-learns features of the local bonding environments of the atoms and learns to predict partial atomic charges from these features. Our trained MPNN assigns high-fidelity partial point charges to MOFs with orders of magnitude lower computational cost than electronic structure calculations.

To this end, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to calculate several thermodynamic and dynam- ical properties of water in MOF-808 as a function of relative humidity (RH), from the initial adsorption step to full pore filling. At low RH, the μ3-OH groups of the SBUs form hydrogen bonds with the initial water molecules entering the pores, which triggers the filling of these pores before the μ3-OH groups in other pores become en- gaged in hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Our analyses indicate that the pores of MOF-808 become filled by water sequentially as the RH increases. A similar mechanism has been reported for water adsorption in UiO-66, a MOF that shares the same SBU with MOF-808.

Requirements for ulta-high purities traditionally necessitate use of virgin sources and thereby hinder the capture, purification, and reuse of these costly gases. Most importantly, gaseous PFCs are incredibly potent greenhouse gases with atmospheric lifetimes on the order of 103-104 years, and thus any environmental emissions have an outsized and prolonged impact on our climate. The development of sorbents that can capture PFC gases from industrial waste streams has lagged substantially behind the progress made over the last decade in capturing CO2 from both point emission sources and directly from air. Herein, we show that the metal–organic framework Zn(fba) (fba2– = 4,4’-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis-benzoate) displays an equilibrium selectivity for CF4 adsorption over N2 that surpasses those of all water-stable sorbents that have been reported for this separation. This selectivity is enabled by adsorption within narrow corrugated channels lined with ligand-based aryl rings, a site within this material that has not previously been realized as being accessible to guests. Analyses of adsorption kinetics and X-ray diffraction data are used to characterize sorption and diffusion of small adsorbates within these channels and strongly implicate rotation of the linker aryl rings as a gate that modulates transport of CF4 through a crystallite. Multi-component breakthrough measurements demonstrate that Zn(fba) is able to resolve CF4 and N2 under flowing mixed-gas conditions.

To achieve this, we trained our neural network only on alchemical species, represented only by their geometry and force field parameters, and used this neural network to predict the loadings of real adsorbates. We focused on predicting room temperature adsorption of small (one- and two-atom) molecules relevant to chemical separations. Namely, argon, krypton, xenon, methane, ethane, and nitrogen. However, we also observed surprisingly promising predictions for more complex molecules, whose properties are outside the range spanned by the alchemical adsorbates. Prediction accuracies suitable for large-scale screening were achieved using simple MOF (e.g. geometric properties and chemical moieties), and adsorbate (e.g. forcefield parameters and geometry) descriptors. Our results illustrate a new philosophy of training that opens the path towards development of machine learning models that can predict the adsorption loading of any new adsorbate at any new operating conditions in any new MOF.</div>",na,"(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND ((MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"") OR porous materials OR adsorption OR gas storage OR separation OR purification))",2024-11-18 16:25:08.248905,False

While these applications have many benefits, they can produce harmful pollutants, such as radioactive iodine, that need to be sequestered. Effective capture and storage of radioactive iodine waste remains a major challenge for nuclear energy generation and nuclear medicine.  Here we report the highly efficient capture of iodine in a series of mesoporous, two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks, called COFamides, which contain amide sidechains in their pores. COFamides are capable of rapidly removing iodine from aqueous solutions at concentrations as low as 50 ppm, with total capacities greater than 650 wt%.  In order to explain the high affinity of the COFamide series for iodine and iodide species in water, we performed a computational analysis of the interactions the COFamide framework and iodine guests.  These studies suggest that the origin of the large iodine capacity in these materials can be explained by the presence of multiple, cooperative, non-covalent interactions between the framework and both iodine, and iodide species.",na,"(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND ((MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"" OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"") OR porous materials OR adsorption OR gas storage OR separation OR purification))",2024-11-18 16:25:08.554003,False

Flexible/dynamic components that respond to adsorbed gas can give MOFs unique or enhanced adsorption properties. Here, we explore the adsorption properties that could be imparted to a MOF by a rotaxane molecular shuttle (RMS) in its pores. In the unit cell of an RMS-MOF, a macrocyclic wheel is mechanically interlocked with a strut of the MOF scaffold. The wheel shuttles between stations on the strut that are also gas adsorption sites. At a level of abstraction similar to the seminal Langmuir adsorption model, we pose and analyze a simple statistical mechanical model of gas adsorption in an RMS-MOF that accounts for (i) wheel/gas competition for sites on the strut and (ii) gas-induced changes in the configurational entropy of the shuttling wheel. We determine how the amount of gas adsorbed, position of the wheel, and differential energy of adsorption depend on temperature, pressure, and the interactions of the gas/wheel with the stations. Our model reveals that, compared to a rigid, Langmuir material, the chemistry of the RMS-MOF can be tuned to render gas adsorption more or less temperature-sensitive and to release more or less heat upon adsorption.

However, navigating this chemical space to identify optimal MOF structures poses a significant challenge. Tradtional high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), while useful, is often limited by a distribution bias towards materials not aligned with the desired functionalities. To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a ”deep dreaming” methodology to optimise MOFs in silico, aiming to generate structures with systematically shifted properties that are closer to target functionalities from the outset. Our methodology
integrates property prediction and structure optimisation within a single interpretable framework, leveraging a specialised chemical language model augmented with attention mechanisms. Focusing on a curated set of MOF properties critical to applications like carbon capture and energy storage, our approach not only expands the selection of potential materials for HTCS but also opens new avenues for material exploration and development.

This raises the question whether a new experimental or predicted structure adds new information. For MOF-chemists the chemical design space is a combination of pore geometry, metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups, but at present we do not have a formalism to quantify optimal coverage of chemical design space. In this work, we show how machine learning can be used to quantify similarities of MOFs. This quantification allows us to use techniques from ecology to analyse the chemical diversity of these materials in terms of diversity metrics. In particular, we show that this diversity analysis can identify biases in the databases, and how such bias can lead to incorrect conclusions.

However, the effect of PSM on molecular transport, which is essential for most applications of MOFs, is rarely studied. In this paper, we used the perfluoroalkane-functionalized Zr-MOF NU-1008 as a platform to systematically interrogate transport processes and mechanisms in solvated pores. We anchored perfluoroalkanes onto NU-1008 nodes by solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI-n, with n = 3, 5, 7, 9 denoting the number of fluorinated carbons). Transport of a luminescent molecule, BODIPY, through individual crystallites of four versions of methanol-filled SALI-n was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy as a function of time and location. In com-parison with the parent NU-1008, the diffusivity of the probe molecules within SALI-n declined by 2 to 7-fold depending on chain length and loading, presumably due to steric effects or adsorptive interactions with per-fluoroalkyl chains. Atomistic simulations were performed to uncover the microscopic behavior of BODIPY dif-fusion in SALI-n. BODIPY molecules, which preferably interact with linkers, were pushed to the interior of the channels as chain length increased, resulting in solvated diffusion and minor differences in the short-time mobility of BODIPY in SALI-n. This suggested that the observed decline of transport diffusivity in SALI-n mainly stemmed from the steric effect from these flexible chains. We anticipate that this proof-of-concept will assist in understanding how pore functionalization can physically and chemically affect mass transport in MOFs and will be useful in further guiding the design of PSM to realize the optimal performance of MOFs for various applications.",na,(Machine Learning OR AI OR Deep Learning) AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND ((MOFs OR ZIFs) OR 'metal-organic frameworks' OR COFs OR 'covalent-organic frameworks'),2024-11-18 16:25:57.545747,False

By adding a mobile redox acceptor molecule to the electrolyte, the additional cross reaction between the film and the acceptor mimics a source-drain electrode configuration, generating a steady state with negligible counter ion flux. Additionally, we construct a bespoke physical model and derive an analytical expression to correct the current response for any electric field effects.

different compositions and structures, distinct by cation exchange, despite using the same set of starting materials. The reaction of an iron polypyridyl complex with a copper salt by diffusion of one solution into another resulted in iron-to-copper exchange, concurrent ligand rearrangement and the formation of MOFs. This observation shows that polypyridyl complexes can be used as expendable precursors for the growth of MOFs. In contrast, alternative depositions of the iron polypyridyl complex with a copper salt by automated spin-coating on conductive metal-oxides resulted in the formation of electrochromic coatings, and the structure and redox properties of the iron complex were retained.

Modifying available achiral structure-bearing MOF scaffolds is a preferred method to extend this class of materials. Reported postsynthetic covalent chiralizations generally lead to uniform, site-specific modifications. The use of chemically versatile modifying agents, like aldehydes, may instead result in the statistical formation of chemically non-uniform anchored products. In addition, use of such modifying agents gives rise to spatial non-uniformities in the radial direction, due to prohibited diffusion through the MOF bulk. The advantageous grain structure formation plus molecular non-uniformity greatly increase the complexity of such systems. The use of such modifying agents, therefore, necessitates a broader, holistic characterization. The present work explores the adaptation of imine chemistry for post-synthetic chiralization. A chiral aldehyde and a chiral ketone are probed on two amine-functionalized MOF substrates - MIL-125 NH2, and UiO-66 NH2. The UiO-66 NH2 modified with the natural product-derived (R)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-carboxaldehyde ((R)-1 aldehyde) is found to have the best performance in terms of reactivity and MOF stability. A comprehensive toolbox of methods was demonstrated to robustly characterize the obtained material. This includes high-resolution accurate mass electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRAM-ESI-MS) to reveal the competing reactions that yield a statistical set of oligomer-rich structures. In silico modeling correctly predicts the localization of the modification. The modification is found to be covalent, chiral, and mainly proceeding through imine formation, resulting in a surface enantioselector display formation. Restricted diffusion lengths in the solid phase infer good retention of resolving power in ascending van Deemter régimes in chromatography. Meeting this criterion makes the yielding material a promising potential stationary phase candidate for performant chromatographic enantioseparations.",na,Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks OR porous materials OR supramolecular chemistry),2024-11-18 16:26:39.318190,False

different zeolitic imidazolate framework systems (ZIF-8, ZIF-8(H), ZIF-8(Br) and ZIF-
8(Cl)), extending the MOF-FF parameterization methodology in two aspects. First,
we implemented the possibility to use periodic reference data in order to prevent the
difficulty of generating representative finite clusters. Second, a more efficient global
optimizer based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES)
was employed during the parameterization process. We confirmed that CMA-ES, as
a state-of-the-art black box optimizer for problems on continuous variables, is more
suitable for force field optimization than the previous genetic algorithm. The obtained
force field was then fully validated with respect to static and dynamic properties. Much
effort was spent to ensure that the FF is able to describe the crucial linker swing effect
in a large number of ZIF-8 derivatives. For this reason we compared our force field to ab initio molecular dynamic simulations and found an accuracy comparable to those
obtained by different exchange–correlation functionals.

The aim of this study was to generate student interest in research by developing a new MOF laboratory experience. Students were tasked with synthesizing, characterizing, and utilizing MOFs to capture a hazardous molecule, using an inquiry-based learning approach. Over three laboratory periods, undergraduate students received instructions for synthesizing four MOFs. They were given the freedom to choose which MOF to synthesize and use for capture of either methylene blue or iodine. This hands-on experience exposed students to techniques not typically explored in general chemistry, including the use of crystallographic information files to examine MOF structures, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. At the end of the term, students presented their work during a formal poster session where they received valuable feedback from faculty and graduate students at Oregon State University. Additionally, students participated in a survey to provide feedback on the learning outcomes of this new experiment, in which they expressed their interest in further exploring MOFs in the future.

Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with metal-free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate-based BioHOF-1. Comparison of different DAAO forms in BioHOF-1 incorporation revealed that N-terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2 (Z-DAAO) promotes the loading (2.5-fold; ~500 mg g-1) and strongly boosts the activity (6.5-fold). To benchmark the HOF composite with metal-organic framework (MOF) composites, Z-DAAO was immobilized into the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), the relatively more hydrophilic analogue metal azolate framework-7 (MAF-7). While sensitivity to the framework environment limited the activity of DAAO@MAF-7 (3.2 U mg-1) and DAAO@ZIF-8 (≤ 0.5 U mg-1), the activity of DAAO@BioHOF-1 was comparable (~45%) to that of soluble DAAO (50.1 U mg-1) and independent of the enzyme loading (100 – 500 mg g-1). The DAAO@BioHOF-1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during solid catalyst recycling.

Here we present the first demonstration for the use of hypergolic metal-organic frameworks (HMOFs) as additives to trigger hypergolic ignition in conventional paraffin-based hybrid engine fuels. HMOFS are a recently introduced class of stable and safe hypergolic materials, used here as a platform to bring readily tunable ignition and combustion properties to hydrocarbon fuels.

Thus far, the structural variety for MOF thin films available through layer-by-layer deposition was limited, as the preparation of those surface-anchored metal-organic frameworks (SURMOFs) has several requirements: Mild conditions, low temperatures, day-long reaction times, and non-aggressive solvents. We herein present a fast method for the preparation of the first MIL SURMOF on Au-surfaces under rather harsh conditions: Using a dynamic layer-by-layer synthesis for MIL-68(In), thin films of adjustable thickness between 50-2000 nm could be deposited within only 60 min. The MIL-68(In) thin film growth was monitored in-situ using a quartz crystal microbalance. In-plane X-ray diffraction revealed oriented MIL-68(In) growth with the pore-channels of this interesting MOF aligned parallel to the support. SEM data demonstrated an extraordinarily low roughness of the MIL-68(In) thin films. Mechanical properties and lateral homogeneity of the layer were probed through nanoindentation. These thin films showed extremely high optical quality. By applying a PMMA layer and further depositing an Au-mirror to the top, a MOF optical cavity was fabricated that can be used as Fabry-Perot interferometer. The MIL-68(In)-based cavity showed a series of sharp resonances in the UV-Vis regime. Changes in the refractive index of MIL-68(In) caused by exposure to volatile compounds, led to pronounced position shifts of the resonances. Thus, these cavities are well suited to be used as optical read-out sensors.

In this work, we explore the fabrication of a compositional series of hybrid blends that combine ZIF-62(Zn) glass and an inorganic glass, 30Na2O-70P2O5, in an effort to combine the chemical versatility of the MOF glass with the mechanical properties of the inorganic glass.  We investigate the interfacial interactions between the two components using pair distribution function analysis and solid state NMR spectroscopy,  and suggest potential interactions between the two phases. Thermal analysis of the blend samples indicated  that they were less thermally stable than the starting materials,   and had a Tg shifted relative to the pristine materials. Annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), nanoindentation and  31P NMR all indicated close mixing of the two phases, suggesting that immiscible blends had formed.

However, multichromic materials that are photophysically resilient and show high sensitivity towards different physical and chemical stimuli are scarce. We report a facile host-guest nanoconfinement strategy to construct a hybrid material with multichromic sensing capabilities. We design and fabricate a new Guest@MOF material: comprising a zeolitic MOF (ZIF-71), acting as a nanoporous host for encapsulating rhodamine B (RhB) guest molecules, resulting in the RhB@ZIF‑71 system with mechanochromic, thermochromic, and solvatochromic sensing response. The multichromic properties stem from the nanoconfinement effect that ZIF-71 imposes on RhB monomers, yielding the H-type or J-type aggregates with tuneable photophysical and photochemical properties. For mechanochromism, the external pressure causes an emission red shift in a linear fashion, switching the RhB guests from H-type to J-type aggregates <i>via</i> a shear mechanism. For thermochromism, we demonstrate a linear scaling as a function of temperature due to the spatial restriction experienced by J-type aggregates incarcerated in ZIF-71 pores. Harnessing the solvatochromism of RhB@ZIF‑71, we identified three diverse groups of volatile organic compounds. The multimodal response could pave the way to smart applications like photonic pressure sensors, non-invasive thermometers, and ultrasensitive chemosensors.</p></div></div></div>",na,"(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND ((MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"") OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"") OR hybrid porous materials)",2024-11-18 16:30:13.722158,False

Here, new two classes of sulfonated -NH-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs), specifically designed for sodium or potassium ion conduction (named i-COF-2 (Na or K) and i-COF-3 (Na or K)), was synthesized through a straightforward, one-step process using affordable starting materials. Remarkably, these COFs demonstrate high ionic conductivity at room temperature—3.17 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 1.02 × 10-4 S cm-1 for i-COF-2 (Na) and i-COF-2 (K) and 2.75 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 1.42 × 10-4 S cm-1 for i-COF-3 (Na) and i-COF-3 (K) —without the need for additional salt or solvent. This enhanced performance, including low activation energies of 0.21 eV for both i-COF-2 (Na) and i-COF-2 (K) and of 0.24 eV and 0.25 eV for i-COF-3 (Na) and i-COF-3 (K), is attributed to the strategic incorporation of sulfonate groups and the directional channels within the COF structure. The Na+ and K+ ion high conductivities, low cost and intrinsic framework stability of i-COF-2 (Na or K) and i-COF-3 (Na or K) provide promising solid electrolyte candidate for the exploration of sustainable energy storage.",na,"(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND ((MOFs OR ZIFs OR ""metal-organic frameworks"") OR COFs OR ""covalent-organic frameworks"") OR hybrid porous materials)",2024-11-18 16:30:14.671487,False

Two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c-COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal-ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and COF-based proton storage is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone-based ladder-type 2D c-COF towards fast proton storage in both mild aqueous Zn-ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the generated C-O- groups via discharge exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable pi-delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c-COF a unique affinity to proton with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c-COF electrode presents outstanding rate capability up to 200 A g-1 (over 2500C). Our work reports the first example of proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of perinone-based 2D c-COF in future energy devices.

conjugated π-electron systems. For this, we first assembled a crystalline
metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor based on Zr(IV) ions and a linear
dicarboxyl linker molecule featuring backfolded, highly unsaturated alkyne
backbones; massive thermocyclization of the organic linkers was then triggered
to install highly conjugated, fused-aromatic bridges throughout the MOF

we present a novel, solvent-free approach to post-synthetic linker exchange in
ZIF-8 through exposure to linker vapor. As in the solvent-based approach, this
vapor-phase linker exchange (VPLE) method retains the parent SOD topology and
proceeds in a single-crystal to single-crystal manner. The scope of linkers
that can be incorporated through VPLE was studied and criteria for the
selection of further candidates were formulated. In large crystals, the
incoming linker was found to form domains instead of distributing homogeneously,
similar as for solution-based linker exchange. In contrast to the latter
approach, VPLE yields a higher concentration of the incoming linker in the
crystal core instead of the shell.",na,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (metal-organic frameworks OR ZIFs OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR (Machine Learning AND (gas adsorption OR gas storage) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)),2024-11-18 16:33:29.007568,False

Accurate VOCs analysis is essential, and require innovative analytical methods for rapid on-site detection without complex sample preparation. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a versatile analytical platform ideal for detecting chemical species. It relies on optical probing metallic nanostructures endowing tightly confined electromagnetic fields associated with resonant coupling to surface plasmons, then boosting the efficiency of Raman scattering to sensitivity at even single molecule detection. Nonetheless, SERS faces limitations, especially analytes that do not bond with noble metals. This limitation can be circumvented by interfacing the sensor surface with Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Known for their chemical and structural versatility, MOFs efficiently pre-concentrate low molecular weight species in their porous structure. This review presents recent developments in MOF-based SERS substrates emphasizing design rules for maximizing analytical performance. An overview of the status of the detection of harmful VOC is discussed in the context of industrial and environmental monitoring. In addition, a survey of VOC analysis for medical diagnosis and emerging applications in aroma and flavor profiling is included.",na,(Machine Learning AND (diffusion OR diffusivity) AND (metal-organic frameworks OR ZIFs OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)) OR (Machine Learning AND (gas adsorption OR gas storage) AND (MOFs OR ZIFs OR metal-organic frameworks OR COFs OR covalent-organic frameworks)),2024-11-18 16:33:35.088041,False
