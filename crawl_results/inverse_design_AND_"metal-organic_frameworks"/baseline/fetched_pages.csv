http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08203v1,"The Origin of the Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline
  Metal-Organic Frameworks","  It is textbookly regarded that phonons, i.e., an energy quantum of
propagating lattice waves, are the main heat carriers in perfect crystals. As a
result, in many crystals, e.g., bulk silicon, the temperature-dependent thermal
conductivity shows the classical 1/T relationship because of the dominant
Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering in the systems. However, the thermal
conductivity of many crystalline metal-organic frameworks is very low and shows
no, a weakly negative and even a weakly positive temperature dependence
(glass-like thermal conductivity). It has been in debate whether the thermal
transport can be still described by phonons in metal-organic frameworks. Here,
by studying two typical systems, i.e., crystal zeolitic imidazolate framework-4
(cZIF-4) and crystal zeolitic imidazolate framework-62 (c-ZIF62), we prove that
the ultralow thermal conductivity in metal-organic frameworks is resulting from
the strong phonon intrinsic structure scattering due to the large mass
difference and the large cavity between Zn and N atoms. Our mean free path
spectrum analysis shows that both propagating and non-propagating anharmonic
vibrational modes exist in the systems, and contribute largely to the thermal
conductivity. The corresponding weakly negative or positive temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity is stemming from the competition between
the propagating and non-propagating anharmonic vibrational modes. Our study
here provides a fundamental understanding of thermal transport in metal-organic
frameworks and will guide the design of the thermal-related applications using
metal-organic frameworks, e.g., inflammable gas storage, chemical catalysis,
solar thermal conversion and so on.

This 1-D gradient of the electrostatic potential causes a closure of the global

http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08148v1,Metal-organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices: A Revised Version,"  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline,
nano-porous materials made of metal-ion-based nodes and organic linkers. Most
of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural
diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation
applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding
and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of
MOFs reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics,
optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the
MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic
applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and
surface-anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition
metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing
tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for
MOFs-based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and
underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review
highlights the pros and cons of MOFs-based electronics, followed by an analysis
of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF
compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and
further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and

  by Metal Substitution and Linker Functionalization","  The chemical flexibility of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers an ideal
platform to tune structure and composition for specific applications, from gas
sensing to catalysis and from photoelectric conversion to energy storage. This
variability gives rise to a large configurational space that can be efficiently
explored using high-throughput computational methods. In this work, we
investigate from first principles the structural and electronic properties of
MOF-5 variants obtained by replacing Zn with Be, Mg, Cd, Ca, Sr, and Ba, and by
functionalizing the originally H-passivated linkers with CH$_3$, NO$_2$, Cl,
Br, NH$_2$, OH, and COOH groups. To build and analyze the resulting 56
structures, we employ density-functional theory calculations embedded in an
in-house developed library for automatized calculations. Our findings reveal
that structural properties are mainly defined by metal atoms and large
functional groups which distort the lattice and modify coordination. Stability
is largely influenced by functionalization and enhanced by COOH and OH groups
which promote the formation of hydrogen bonds. The charge distribution within
the linker is especially influenced by functional groups with
electron-withdrawing character while the metal nodes play a minor role.
Likewise, the band-gap size is crucially determined by ligand
functionalization. The smallest gaps are found with NH$_2$ and OH groups which
introduce localized orbitals at the top of the valence band. This
characteristic makes these functionalizations particularly promising for the
design of MOF-5 variants with enhanced gas uptake and sensing properties.

demonstrated to possess larger pore volume and thus better larger gas uptake
capacity compared to their powder forms. Here, we systematically investigated
the water vapor adsorption kinetics in a prototypical MOF, i.e., MOF-801. Our
results show that the total pore volume (average pore diameter) of the
monolithic MOF-801 is 0.831 cm3/g (5.20 nm) which is much larger than that of
powder MOF-801, i.e., 0.488 cm3/g (1.95 nm). Unexpectedly, we find that the
water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801 is much lower than that of powder
MOF-801 when the RH ranges from 10% to 90%. Our molecular dynamics simulations
further demonstrate that the unexpected water uptake capacity of monolithic
MOF-801 at RH of 10%~90% is caused by the water film formed by the capillary
condensation in these mesopores of monolithic MOF-801. The water molecules can
overcome the capillary force when the RH is higher than 90%, and then leads to
the increase of the corresponding water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801.

Moreover, our theoretical modeling provides a basis for understanding both

require or possess qualitative (categorical) information. Metal-organic

incorporate qualitative information into design optimization. Furthermore, the
large number of potential building blocks leads to a combinatorial challenge,

physics-based approaches. In this work, we integrated Latent Variable Gaussian
Process (LVGP) and Multi-Objective Batch-Bayesian Optimization (MOBBO) to
identify top-performing MOFs adaptively, autonomously, and efficiently without
any human intervention. Our approach provides three main advantages: (i) no
specific physical descriptors are required and only building blocks that
construct the MOFs are used in global optimization through qualitative
representations, (ii) the method is application and property independent, and
(iii) the latent variable approach provides an interpretable model of
qualitative building blocks with physical justification. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we considered a design space with more than 47,000
MOF candidates. By searching only ~1% of the design space, LVGP-MOBBO was able
to identify all MOFs on the Pareto front and more than 97% of the 50

apply to different quasiparticle models. Here, we focus on a tight-binding
approach for the electronic case as a proof of principle. The resulting
high-degeneracy points are protected by the site-permutation symmetries,
yielding pseudospin-1 and -2 Dirac fermions. The strategy proposed here can be
used to design lattices with high-degeneracy points in electronic (e.g.

extensively studied due to various possible applications exploiting their large
amount of internal surface area. Phonon properties of MOFs are, however, still
largely unexplored, despite their relevance for thermal and electrical
conductivities, thermal expansion, and mechanical properties. Here, we use
quantum-mechanical simulations to provide an in-depth analysis of the phonon
properties of isoreticular MOFs. We consider phonon band structures, spatial
confinements of modes, projected densities of states, and group velocity
distributions. We find that more complex linkers shift the spectral weight of
the phonon density of states towards higher frequencies, while increasing the
mass of the metal atoms in the nodes has the opposite effect. Due to the high
porosity of MOFs, we observe a particularly pronounced polarization dependence
of the dispersion of acoustic phonons with rather high group velocities for
longitudinal acoustic modes. Interestingly, also for several optical phonon
modes group velocities amounting to several thousand m/s are obtained. For
heterogeneous systems like MOFs, correlating group velocities and the
displacement of modes is particularly relevant. Here we find that high group
velocities are generally associated with delocalized vibrations, while the
inverse correlation does not necessarily hold. To quantify anharmonicities, we
calculate mode Gr\""uneisen parameters, which we find to be significant only for
phonons with frequencies below ~3 THz. The presented results provide the

optimizing 3D atomic structure of MOFs, which adds one extra step when
evaluating hypothetical MOFs. In this work, we propose a structure-agnostic
deep learning method based on the Transformer model, named as MOFormer, for
property predictions of MOFs. The MOFormer takes a text string representation

reveal energy flux patterns whose length scale correlates with the catalyst
packing. By exploiting the motional averaging under a weak applied
magnetic-field gradient, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) linewidths are
inversely proportional to temperature. Measurements during the hydrogenation of
propylene in reactors packed with metal nanoparticles and metal-organic
framework catalysts yield temperature coefficients of ~0.1 Hz/K, and
temperature error <4%. Temperature sensitivity increases with gradient
strength, enabling tuning of precision.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00340v1,"Dye-Encapsulated Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-71) for
  Fluorochromic Sensing of Pressure, Temperature, and Volatile Solvents","  Luminescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a multifunctional platform
for creating non-invasive sensors and tuneable optoelectronics. However,
fluorochromic materials that are photophysically resilient and show high
sensitivity towards different physical and chemical stimuli are scarce. We
report a facile host-guest nanoconfinement strategy to construct a fluorescent
hybrid material with multiple sensing capabilities. We design and fabricate a
new Guest@MOF material: comprising a zeolitic MOF (ZIF-71) as a nanoporous host
for encapsulating rhodamine B (RhB dye) guest molecules, resulting in the
RhB@ZIF-71 system with mechanochromic, thermochromic, and solvatochromic
sensing response. The fluorochromic sensing properties stem from the
nanoconfinement effect that ZIF-71 imposes on RhB monomers, yielding the H- or
J-type aggregates with tuneable photophysical and photochemical properties. For
mechanochromism, the external pressure causes an emission red shift in a linear
fashion, switching RhB guests from H-type to J-type aggregates through a shear
deformation. For thermochromism, we demonstrate a linear scaling as a function
of temperature due to the spatial restriction imposed on J-type aggregates
incarcerated in ZIF-71 pores. Harnessing the solvatochromism of RhB@ZIF-71, we
identified three diverse groups of volatile organic compounds. The multimodal
sensing response pave the way to smart applications like photonic pressure
sensors, non-invasive thermometers, and ultrasensitive chemosensors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11023v2,"Predicting Material Properties Using a 3D Graph Neural Network with
  Invariant Local Descriptors","  Accurate prediction of physical properties is critical for discovering and
designing novel materials. Machine learning technologies have attracted
significant attention in the materials science community for their potential
for large-scale screening. Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCNN) is one of
the most successful machine learning methods because of its flexibility and
effectiveness in describing 3D structural data. Most existing GCNN models focus
on the topological structure but overly simplify the three-dimensional
geometric structure. However, in materials science, the 3D-spatial distribution
of atoms is crucial for determining the atomic states and interatomic forces.
This paper proposes an adaptive GCNN with a novel convolution mechanism that
simultaneously models atomic interactions among all neighbor atoms in
three-dimensional space. We apply the proposed model to two distinctly
challenging problems on predicting material properties. The first is Henry's
constant for gas adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), which is
notoriously difficult because of its high sensitivity to atomic configurations.
The second is the ion conductivity in solid-state crystal materials, which is
difficult because of few labeled data available for training. The new model
outperforms existing graph-based models on both data sets, suggesting that the
critical three-dimensional geometric information is indeed captured.

  Applicable to Arbitrary Combination of 45 Elements","  Computational material discovery is under intense study owing to its ability
to explore the vast space of chemical systems. Neural network potentials (NNPs)
have been shown to be particularly effective in conducting atomistic
simulations for such purposes. However, existing NNPs are generally designed
for narrow target materials, making them unsuitable for broader applications in
material discovery. To overcome this issue, we have developed a universal NNP

diverse set of virtual structures used to attain the universality. We
demonstrated the applicability of PFP in selected domains: lithium diffusion in
LiFeSO${}_4$F, molecular adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, an
order-disorder transition of Cu-Au alloys, and material discovery for a
Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. They showcase the power of PFP, and this technology
provides a highly useful tool for material discovery.

  Sensors","  Ultra-sensitive and highly selective iodine gas sensors play a crucial role
during the nuclear radiation leak for a timely detection and mitigation of
pollution, ensuring the safety of a vast number of operators and subsequent
integrity of the facility. Herein, we rationally designed a metal-organic
framework (MOF) that exhibits an outstanding performance with an almost
billion-fold enhancement in the electrical response due to its optimized
hydrophobicity, which allows the easy migration of iodine molecules though the
channels and the presence of suitable interaction sites, temporarily anchoring
the target molecule for ultra-trace sensing. The prototype sensor tested in
demanding environments demonstrates its high selectivity, ultra-trace parts per
billion (ppb)-level sensitivity, good reversibility, and a very fast response
time even at high frequencies compared to existing adsorbents, including
commercially available materials. Further, the iodine sensing at the atomic
level was studied in detail by measuring the electrical response of a single
crystal and, the optimal thickness of the MOF layer was identified for an
industrially-viable prototype sensor by using inkjet printing. In a wider
perspective, we propose a general strategy towards electrically efficient
sensing materials with hybrid functionalities for engineering high-sensitivity
iodine sensors for a safe and sustainable future.

window to unconventional phases of matter. The paradigmatic frustrated lattice
in three dimensions to host a spin liquid is the pyrochlore, although there
remain few experimental compounds thought to realize such a state. Here we go
beyond the pyrochlore via molecular design in the metal-azolate framework
[Mn(II)(ta)$_2$], which realizes a closely related centred pyrochlore lattice
of Mn-spins with $S=5/2$. Despite a Curie-Weiss temperature of $-21$ K
indicating the energy scale of magnetic interactions, [Mn(II)(ta)$_2$] orders
at only 430 mK, putting it firmly in the category of highly frustrated magnets.
Comparing magnetization and specific heat measurements to numerical results for
a minimal Heisenberg model, we predict that this material displays distinct
features of a classical spin liquid with a structure factor reflecting Coulomb

stable rectifying device with the possibility of commercialization is a ""holy
grail"" of molecular electronics. Molecular rectifiers do not only exploit the
electronic function of the molecules but also offer the possibility of their
direct integration into specific nano-electronic circuits. However, even after
nearly three decades of extensive experimental and theoretical work, the
concept of molecular rectifiers still has many unresolved aspects concerning
both the fundamental understanding of the underlying phenomena and the

systems with rectification ratios exceeding 105 are highly promising and
competitive to the existing silicon-based devices. Here, we provide an overview
and critical analysis of the current state and recent progress in molecular
rectification relying on the different design concepts and material platforms
such as single molecules, self-assembled monolayers, molecular multilayers,
heterostructures, and metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers. The

http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09251v2,Universal Machine Learning Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian for Materials,"  While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational
approach in electronic structure calculations, its computational demands and
scalability limitations persist. Recently, leveraging neural networks to
parameterize the Kohn-Sham DFT Hamiltonian has emerged as a promising avenue
for accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements,
challenges such as the necessity for computing extensive DFT training data to
explore each new system and the complexity of establishing accurate ML models
for multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study
introduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian

predicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including
complex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\'e twisted
bilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we
utilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of
electronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940
crystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering
a reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this

  using Machine Learning","  Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms
focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty
in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends in both
types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical
structures. Moreover, models trained only on single gas adsorption data are
incapable of predicting adsorption isotherms for binary gas mixtures. In this
work, we address these problems using feature vectors comprising only the
physical properties of the gas mixtures and adsorbents. Our model is trained on
adsorption isotherms of both single and binary mixed gases inside carbon
molecular sieving membrane (CMSM), together with data available from CoRE MOF
database. The trained models are capable of accurately predicting the
adsorption trends in both classes of materials, for both pure and binary
components. ML architecture designed for one class of material, is not suitable
for predicting the other class, even after proper training, signifying that the
model must be trained jointly for proper predictions and transferability. The
model is used to predict with good accuracy the CO2 uptake inside CALF-20
framework. This work opens up a new avenue for predicting complex adsorption

http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04665v1,"LLM-based MOFs Synthesis Condition Extraction using Few-Shot
  Demonstrations","  The extraction of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) synthesis conditions from
literature text has been challenging but crucial for the logical design of new
MOFs with desirable functionality. The recent advent of large language models
(LLMs) provides disruptively new solution to this long-standing problem and
latest researches have reported over 90% F1 in extracting correct conditions
from MOFs literature. We argue in this paper that most existing synthesis
extraction practices with LLMs stay with the primitive zero-shot learning,
which could lead to downgraded extraction and application performance due to
the lack of specialized knowledge. This work pioneers and optimizes the
few-shot in-context learning paradigm for LLM extraction of material synthesis
conditions. First, we propose a human-AI joint data curation process to secure
high-quality ground-truth demonstrations for few-shot learning. Second, we
apply a BM25 algorithm based on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
technique to adaptively select few-shot demonstrations for each MOF's
extraction. Over a dataset randomly sampled from 84,898 well-defined MOFs, the
proposed few-shot method achieves much higher average F1 performance (0.93 vs.
0.81, +14.8%) than the native zero-shot LLM using the same GPT-4 model, under
fully automatic evaluation that are more objective than the previous human
evaluation. The proposed method is further validated through real-world
material experiments: compared with the baseline zero-shot LLM, the proposed
few-shot approach increases the MOFs structural inference performance (R^2) by
29.4% in average.
