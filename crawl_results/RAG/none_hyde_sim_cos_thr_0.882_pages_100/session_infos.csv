The objective is to develop a novel approach that leverages RAGs to automatically generate high-quality code for specific programming tasks. The proposed methodology involves training a deep neural network on a large dataset of annotated code examples, where the RAG is used to encode context-dependent relationships between code elements. The trained model is then employed to predict missing code fragments and generate complete functions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating accurate and efficient code. The findings have significant implications for the field of software engineering, particularly in areas such as automated code completion, code review, and code generation for machine learning models.'}","RAG AND ""code generation""",0,20,0:01:00.212429
